"""U(1)_fitness symmetry structure tests.

This module implements tests for the U(1) fitness gauge symmetry, comparing the
current framework (raw distance-based phases) with the proposed framework (collective
field-based phases).

**Framework References:**
- old_docs/source/13_fractal_set_new/03_yang_mills_noether.md - Current U(1) structure
- old_docs/source/13_fractal_set_new/04_symmetry_redefinition_viability_analysis.md §3.1 - Proposed U(1)

**Current U(1) Structure:**
- Phase: θ_ik^(div) = -d_alg²(i,k)/(2ε_d² ℏ_eff) (pairwise, geometric)
- Amplitude: √P_comp(k|i) from softmax over distances
- Dressed walker: |ψ_i⟩ = Σ_k √P(k|i) · e^(iθ_ik) |k⟩

**Proposed U(1) Structure:**
- Phase: θ_i = (d'_i)^β / ℏ_eff (collective field value)
- Amplitude: SAME as current
- Dressed walker: |ψ_i⟩ = Σ_k √P(k|i) · e^(iθ_i) |k⟩

**Key Difference:**
- Current: Pairwise phases θ_ik depend on (i,k) pair geometry
- Proposed: Walker phases θ_i depend on collective field d'_i (entire swarm through ρ-stats)
