"""Variance decomposition (Parallel Axis Theorem) validation helpers.

Source reference: docs/source/1_euclidean_gas/05_kinetic_contraction.md:1801-1811

Algebraic claims verified:
1) (1/N) * Σ ||v_i||^2 = (1/N) * Σ ||v_i - μ_v||^2 + ||μ_v||^2
2) Var(v) := (1/N) * Σ ||v_i - μ_v||^2 = (1/N) * Σ ||v_i||^2 - ||μ_v||^2

Notes on framework symbol conventions:
- μ_v (mu_v): barycenter/mean velocity vector
- Var(v): mean-squared deviation

The symbolic verification is performed component-wise in 1D using SymPy
summation with symbolic N, which implies the vector identity via additivity
of the squared Euclidean norm across components.

    """Symbolically verify the Parallel Axis Theorem with N as a symbol.

    Verifies both equivalent rearrangements:
      1) (1/N) Σ ||v_i||^2 = (1/N) Σ ||v_i - μ_v||^2 + ||μ_v||^2
      2) Var(v) := (1/N) Σ ||v_i - μ_v||^2 = (1/N) Σ ||v_i||^2 - ||μ_v||^2

    Approach:
      - Use a 1D symbolic sequence {v_i} with Σ over i=1..N (N symbolic)
      - Define μ_v = (1/N) Σ v_i
      - Expand and simplify using Σ(μ_v^2) = N μ_v^2 and Σ v_i = N μ_v

    Returns:
      True if both identities reduce to 0 when rearranged; otherwise False.
