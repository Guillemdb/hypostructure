# Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry Translation Sketches

## Overview

This index provides a comprehensive guide to the Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry translations of hypostructure theorems. Each sketch establishes formal correspondences between abstract dynamical systems concepts and concrete number-theoretic and algebraic constructions.

**Purpose:** These translations serve researchers in algebraic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and Diophantine analysis seeking to understand hypostructure through classical arithmetic concepts.

## Translation Framework

| Semiflow $S_t$ | Galois action, Frobenius |
| Energy functional $\Phi$ | Height function $h$ |
| Dissipation $\mathfrak{D}$ | Ramification, Conductor |
| Singularity $\Sigma$ | Bad reduction, Ramified primes |
