## The Universal Gate Evaluator Interface

:::{div} feynman-prose

Now here is where we get to the heart of the matter. We want to build a machine that can look at any dynamical system - a fluid, a neural network, a proof search algorithm, whatever - and decide whether it is going to behave nicely or blow up in our faces.

The trouble is, these systems look completely different on the surface. A fluid has velocities and pressures, a graph has nodes and edges, a type theory has terms and judgments. How can we possibly have one framework that handles all of them?

The answer is to ask: what do we actually need to check? Forget the specifics. Every system we care about has some notion of "state" (where it is now), some notion of "cost" or "energy" (how far from equilibrium it is), and some notion of "evolution" (how it changes over time). If we can measure these things, we can check whether the system is behaving.

So what follows is a kind of universal checklist - a sequence of gates that any system must pass through. Each gate asks a specific yes-or-no question: Is the energy bounded? Do discrete events accumulate? Is the system converging somewhere sensible? And so on.

The magic is that once you translate your particular system into this common language, the same verification machinery applies to all of them. That is what we mean by "universal."

A Hypostructure $\mathbb{H}$ is an object in a cohesive $(\infty, 1)$-topos $\mathcal{E}$ equipped with a **Gate Evaluator Interface**. This interface maps abstract structural data to decidable types (Propositions) that the Sieve machine can verify.

To support everything from **Navier-Stokes** to **Graph Theory** to **Homotopy Type Theory**, we define the interfaces using the language of **Higher Topos Theory** (specifically, internal logic of an $(\infty,1)$-topos). This allows "Space" to be a manifold, a graph, or a type; "Energy" to be a functional, a complexity measure, or a truth value.



### Ambient Structure

:::{div} feynman-prose

Before we can ask questions about a system, we need to say what kind of mathematical universe it lives in. This is like asking "what is the stage on which our drama plays out?"

The answer is a topos - specifically, a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos. Now that sounds terrifying, but the idea is simple: a topos is a mathematical universe where you can do logic. It has objects (the things), morphisms (the relationships), and a notion of truth. The "cohesive" part means it knows about topology - it can distinguish between "connected" and "disconnected," between "nearby" and "far away."

Why do we need such generality? Because a fluid lives in the world of smooth manifolds, a graph lives in the world of discrete sets, and a type lives in the world of homotopy types. By working in a topos, we get a single language that speaks to all of them.

:::


:::{prf:definition} Ambient Topos (Formal)
:label: def-ambient-topos-formal

An **Ambient Topos** for hypostructure analysis is a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathcal{E}$ equipped with:
1. A terminal object $1 \in \mathcal{E}$
2. Shape/flat/sharp modalities $(\int, \flat, \sharp)$ satisfying cohesion axioms
3. An internal type-theoretic logic with judgments $\Gamma \vdash t : A$
4. A subobject classifier $\Omega$ (truth values)
:::

**Notation:**
- $\mathcal{X}$: The object in $\mathcal{E}$ representing the system state (Space/Type)
- $\mathcal{H}$: The height object representing values/costs
- $\Omega$: The subobject classifier (truth values)
- $\vdash$: The judgment symbol ("System implements...")

:::{prf:definition} Height Object
:label: def-height-object

A **Height Object** $\mathcal{H}$ in $\mathcal{E}$ is an object equipped with:
1. A partial order $\leq: \mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{H} \to \Omega$
2. A bottom element $0: 1 \to \mathcal{H}$
3. An addition operation $+: \mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}$ (for accumulation)

| Domain | Height Object $\mathcal{H}$ | Interpretation |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|
| PDEs | $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ (Dedekind reals) | Energy |
| Graphs | $\mathbb{N}$ | Discrete count |
| HoTT | $\text{Level}$ | Universe level |
| Tropical | $\mathbb{T}_\infty = ([0,\infty], \min, +)$ | Min-plus algebra |

Now here is the key abstraction. An "interface" is just a contract between the system and the verifier. It says: "If you can tell me these things about your system (the required structure), then I can compute a definite answer to this question (the evaluator), and I will give you a proof of my answer (the certificate)."

Think of it like a type signature in programming. The interface does not care how you implement the internals - it just needs you to expose certain data in a certain form. Then it can do its job.

The three **epistemic statuses** are crucial:
- **YES** means "I checked, and the property holds. Here is the proof."
- **NO** with a witness means "I found a counterexample. Here is the offending object."
- **INC** (inconclusive) means "I ran out of time or my method does not apply. I am not saying the property fails - I just cannot decide."

Routing is still **binary**: INC is encoded as a NO with an inconclusive certificate. This keeps the
Sieve deterministic while preserving epistemic honesty about undecidable checks.

:::

:::{prf:definition} Interface Permit
:label: def-interface-permit

An **Interface Permit** $I$ is a tuple $(\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{K})$ consisting of:
1. **Required Structure** $\mathcal{D}$: Objects and morphisms in $\mathcal{E}$ the system must define.
2. **Evaluator** $\mathcal{P}$: A procedure $\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{D} \to \{\texttt{YES}, \texttt{NO}\} \times \mathcal{K}$:
   - **YES:** Predicate holds with constructive witness ($K^+$)
   - **NO:** Predicate refuted with counterexample ($K^{\mathrm{wit}}$) **or** inconclusive ($K^{\mathrm{inc}}$)

   The outcome is deterministic given the computation budget: INC indicates resource exhaustion, not non-determinism, and is encoded as NO with $K^{\mathrm{inc}}$.
3. **Certificate Type** $\mathcal{K}$: The witness structure produced by the evaluation, always a sum type $K^+ \sqcup K^{\mathrm{wit}} \sqcup K^{\mathrm{inc}}$.

A system **implements** Interface $I$ if it provides interpretations for all objects in $\mathcal{D}$ and a computable evaluator for $\mathcal{P}$.

**Evaluation Model (Free-Evaluator Semantics):**
Interfaces may be evaluated in any order permitted by their structural dependencies. The diagram represents a *conventional evaluation flow*, but any interface evaluator $\mathcal{P}_i$ may be called at any time if its required structure ($\mathcal{D}_i$) is available. Certificate accumulation is monotonic but not strictly sequential.

This enables:
- Early evaluation of downstream gates when prerequisites are met
- Parallel evaluation of independent interfaces
- Caching and reuse of certificates across Sieve traversals

### $\mathcal{H}_0$ (Substrate Interface)
*The Substrate Definition.*

:::{div} feynman-prose

This is Gate Zero - the most basic question we can ask: does the system even exist in a well-defined sense? Can you tell me what states it can be in, and how it evolves from one state to another?

You might think this is trivial, but it is not. Some PDEs do not have solutions for all initial data. Some algorithms get stuck in infinite loops. Some type-theoretic constructions are not well-founded. This gate catches those problems at the door.

The key insight is the "refinement filter" - a way of taking limits. This matters because many interesting systems are defined as limits of approximations (think of the Navier-Stokes equations as limits of regularized equations). The substrate interface says: "You must tell me how limits work in your system."

:::

:::{prf:definition} Interface $\mathcal{H}_0$
:label: def-interface-h0

**Purpose:** Ensures the system is a valid object in the topos with a notion of "existence."

**Required Structure ($\mathcal{D}$):**
- **State Object:** An object $\mathcal{X} \in \text{Obj}(\mathcal{E})$.
- **Evolution Morphism:** A family of endomorphisms $S_t: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}$ (the flow/algorithm).
- **Refinement Filter:** A topology or filtration $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathcal{X}$ allowing limits (e.g., metric completion, domain theory limits).

**Evaluator ($\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{H}_0}$):**
Is the morphism $S_t$ well-defined on the domain of interest?

$$\vdash S_t \in \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{E}}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})$$

**Certificates ($\mathcal{K}_{\mathcal{H}_0}$):**
- $K_{\mathcal{H}_0}^+$: A witness term $w : S_t$.
- $K_{\mathcal{H}_0}^-$: A witness that $\text{dom}(S_t) = \emptyset$ (Vacuous system).

**Does Not Promise:** Global existence. The refinement filter may exhaust at finite time.
:::



### $D_E$ (Energy Interface)
*The Cost Interface. Enables Node 1: EnergyCheck*

:::{div} feynman-prose

If the substrate interface asks "does this thing exist?", the energy interface asks "is it going somewhere sensible?"

Here is the intuition. Almost every well-behaved dynamical system has some quantity that decreases (or at least does not increase without bound) as time goes on. For fluids, it is kinetic energy. For optimization algorithms, it is the loss function. For theorem provers, it might be the complexity of the remaining goals.

This interface asks: what is your "height function"? How do you measure progress? And crucially: can you guarantee that the system does not climb forever?

The key inequality is $\Phi(S_t x) \leq \Phi(x) + \int \mathfrak{D}$. Read this as: "the energy at time $t$ is at most the initial energy plus whatever dissipation happened along the way." If dissipation is negative (the system is losing energy), this is a bound. If dissipation can be positive without limit, you have a potential blow-up.

- $K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^+$: The exponent $\theta \in (0, 1]$.
- $K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^-$: A witness of flatness (e.g., a non-trivial kernel of the Hessian).

:::



### $\mathrm{Mon}_\phi$ (Monotonicity Interface)
*The Virial/Morawetz Interface. Enables Soft→Rigidity Compilation*

:::{prf:definition} Interface $\mathrm{Mon}_\phi$ (Monotonicity / Virial-Morawetz)

:::



### $\mathrm{TB}_\rho$ (Mixing Interface)
*Enables Node 10: ErgoCheck*

:::{prf:definition} Interface $\mathrm{TB}_\rho$
:label: def-interface-tbrho

**Purpose:** Defines ergodic/mixing properties of the dynamics.

**Required Structure ($\mathcal{D}$):**

- **Invariant Subobject:** $\text{Inv}_S \hookrightarrow \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X})$.
- **Mixing Time Morphism:** $\tau_{\text{mix}}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}$.

:::



### $\mathrm{Rep}_K$ (Dictionary Interface)
*The Equivalence Interface. Enables Node 11: ComplexCheck*

:::{prf:definition} Interface $\mathrm{Rep}_K$
:label: def-interface-repk

**Purpose:** Defines the mapping between the "Territory" (System) and the "Map" (Representation).

**Required Structure ($\mathcal{D}$):**
- **Language Object:** $\mathcal{L} \in \text{Obj}(\mathcal{E})$ (formal language or category).
- **Dictionary Morphism:** $D: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{L}$.
- **Faithfulness:** An inverse map $D^{-1}$ or equivalence witness.
- **Complexity:** $K: \mathcal{L} \to \mathbb{N}_\infty$.

**Evaluator ($\mathcal{P}_{11}$ - ComplexCheck):**
Is the state representable with finite complexity?

$$K(D(x)) < \infty$$

**Stochastic Extension:** For stochastic systems (e.g., post-S12), complexity refers to the Kolmogorov complexity of the probability law $K(\mu)$, defined as the shortest program that samples from the distribution. Formally: $K(\mu) := \min\{|p| : U(p, r) \sim \mu \text{ for random } r\}$. This ensures that SDEs with finite-description coefficients $(b, \sigma)$ satisfy the complexity check even though individual sample paths are algorithmically random.

**Computability Warning:** $K(\mu)$ is uncomputable in general (Rice's Theorem for distributions). Consequently, $\mathrm{Rep}_K$ for stochastic systems typically returns $K^{\mathrm{inc}}$ unless an explicit program witness $p$ with $U(p, r) \sim \mu$ is provided by the user. The framework remains sound—$K^{\mathrm{inc}}$ routes Lock to geometry-only tactics (E1--E3).

**Certificates ($\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{Rep}_K}$):**
- $K_{\mathrm{Rep}_K}^+$: The code/description $p$.
- $K_{\mathrm{Rep}_K}^-$: A proof of uncomputability or undecidability.

**Does Not Promise:** Computability.

**Epistemic Role:** $\mathrm{Rep}_K$ is the boundary between "analysis engine" and "conjecture prover engine." When $\mathrm{Rep}_K$ produces a NO-inconclusive certificate ($K_{\mathrm{Rep}_K}^{\mathrm{inc}}$), the Lock uses only geometric tactics (E1--E3).

$$v \stackrel{?}{=} -\nabla_g \Phi$$

**Evaluator ($\mathcal{P}_{12}$ - OscillateCheck):**
Does the system follow the gradient?

$$\mathfrak{D}(x) = \|\nabla_g \Phi(x)\|^2$$

**Certificates ($\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{GC}_\nabla}$):**
- $K_{\mathrm{GC}_\nabla}^+$ (Oscillation Present): Witness of oscillatory behavior (symplectic structure, curl, or non-gradient dynamics).
- $K_{\mathrm{GC}_\nabla}^-$ (Gradient Flow): Witness that flow is monotonic (no oscillation, pure gradient descent).

**Does Not Promise:** Absence of oscillation.

**Optionality:** $\mathrm{GC}_\nabla$ is not required for basic singularity exclusion. It only unlocks "explicit Lyapunov/action reconstruction" upgrades.

:label: def-interface-gc-t

**Purpose:** Verifies that control inputs align with safe descent directions.

**Required Structure ($\mathcal{D}$):**
- **Control Law:** $T: \mathcal{U} \to \mathcal{X}$ (the realized control).
- **Desired Behavior:** $d \in \mathcal{Y}$ (the reference or goal).
- **Alignment Metric:** Distance function $\Delta: \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$.

**Evaluator ($\mathcal{P}_{16}$ - AlignCheck):**
Is the control matched to the desired behavior?

$$\Delta(T(u), d) \leq \varepsilon_{\text{align}}$$

**Certificates ($\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{GC}_T}$):**
- $K_{\mathrm{GC}_T}^+$ (Aligned Control): $(\text{alignment certificate}, \Delta_{\text{achieved}})$.
- $K_{\mathrm{GC}_T}^-$ (Misaligned): $(\text{misalignment mode})$ — triggers BarrierVariety.

### $\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}$ (Categorical Interface)
*Enables Node 17: The Lock (BarrierExclusion)*

:::{div} feynman-prose

And here we arrive at the Lock - the final gate, the moment of truth.

All the previous interfaces were about checking specific properties: energy bounds, compactness, scaling, topology. But they do not directly answer the question we really care about: will the system blow up or not?

The Lock approaches this differently. It asks: "I have a library of known bad patterns - the canonical ways that singularities can form in systems of your type. Can any of these bad patterns embed into your system?"

This is a categorical question. A "morphism" from a bad pattern $B$ to your hypostructure $\mathcal{H}$ would mean that $B$ can be realized inside $\mathcal{H}$ - that your system contains the seeds of singularity. If no such morphism exists (the Hom-set is empty), then your system is structurally forbidden from developing that kind of singularity.

The beautiful thing is that this reduces an analytic question (will something blow up?) to an algebraic question (do certain morphisms exist?). And algebraic questions are often much more tractable.

:::{prf:definition} Interface $\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}$
:label: def-interface-cathom

**Purpose:** Final structural consistency verification. Certifies that no bad pattern from the library embeds into the candidate hypostructure, establishing global regularity.

**Required Structure ($\mathcal{D}$):**
- **Hypostructure Category:** $\mathbf{Hypo}_T$ — the category of admissible hypostructures for type $T$.
- **Bad Pattern Library:** $\mathcal{B} = \{B_i\}_{i \in I}$ — a finite set of *minimal bad patterns* committed to for problem type $T$. Each $B_i \in \text{Obj}(\mathbf{Hypo}_T)$ is a canonical singularity-forming structure.
- **Morphism Spaces:** $\text{Hom}_{\mathbf{Hypo}_T}(B_i, \mathcal{H})$ for each $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$.

**Completeness Axiom (Problem-Type Dependent):**
For each problem type $T$, we assume: *every singularity of type $T$ factors through some $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$.* This is a **problem-specific axiom** that must be verified for each instantiation (e.g., for Navier-Stokes, the library consists of known blow-up profiles; for Riemann Hypothesis, the library consists of zero-causing structures).

**Evaluator ($\mathcal{P}_{17}$ - BarrierExclusion):**

$$\forall i \in I: \text{Hom}_{\mathbf{Hypo}_T}(B_i, \mathcal{H}) = \emptyset$$

The Lock evaluator checks whether any morphism exists from any bad pattern to the candidate hypostructure. If all Hom-sets are empty, no singularity-forming pattern can embed, and global regularity follows.

**Certificates ($\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}}$):**
- $K_{\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}}^{\mathrm{blk}}$ (Blocked/VICTORY): Proof that $\forall i: \text{Hom}(B_i, \mathcal{H}) = \emptyset$. Techniques include:
  - **E1 (Dimension):** $\dim(B_i) > \dim(\mathcal{H})$
  - **E2 (Invariant Mismatch):** $I(B_i) \neq I(\mathcal{H})$ for preserved invariant $I$
  - **E3 (Positivity/Integrality):** Obstruction from positivity or integrality constraints
  - **E4 (Functional Equation):** No solution to induced functional equations
  - **E5 (Modular):** Obstruction from modular/arithmetic properties
- $K_{\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}}^{\mathrm{morph}}$ (Breached/FATAL): Explicit morphism $f: B_i \to \mathcal{H}$ for some $i$, witnessing that singularity formation is possible.

**Does Not Promise:** That the Lock is decidable. Tactics E1-E13 may exhaust without resolution, yielding a Breached-inconclusive certificate ($K_{\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}}^{\mathrm{br\text{-}inc}}$).

**Remark (Library vs. Universal Object):**
The universal bad object $\mathbb{H}_{\mathrm{bad}}^{(T)}$ is well-defined as the colimit over the **small** germ set $\mathcal{G}_T$ (see {prf:ref}`mt-krnl-exclusion`, Initiality Lemma). The Small Object Argument ({cite}`Quillen67` §II.3) ensures $\mathcal{G}_T$ is a genuine set by exploiting energy bounds and symmetry quotients. The library formulation $\mathcal{B} = \{B_i\}_{i \in I}$ is the **constructive implementation**: it provides a finite list of computable representatives. The density theorem {prf:ref}`mt-fact-germ-density` proves that checking $\mathcal{B}$ suffices to verify the full categorical obstruction.

### What base level Does NOT Promise

At the soft layer, the framework does **not** assume:

- **Global regularity**: Solutions may blow up; the sieve determines whether they must
- **Finite canonical profile library**: Profiles may be classified, stratified, or horizon
- **Surgery admissibility**: Each surgery must be checked via the Admissibility Trichotomy
- **Decidable Lock outcomes**: E1--E13 tactics may exhaust without resolution
- **Unique gradient structure**: $\mathrm{GC}_\nabla$ is optional; many systems lack gradient form
- **Closed system**: $\mathrm{Bound}$ explicitly handles open systems with inputs

These are obtained by **upgrades**:
- Profile Classification Trichotomy (finite library, tame stratification, or horizon)
- Surgery Admissibility Trichotomy (admissible, admissible$^\sim$, or inadmissible)
- Promotion rules (blocked $\to$ YES via certificate accumulation)
- Lock tactics (E1--E13 for Hom-emptiness proofs)

This separation makes the framework **honest about its assumptions** and enables systematic identification of what additional structure is needed when an inconclusive NO certificate ($K^{\mathrm{inc}}$) is produced.



### Backend-Specific Permits (Specialized Certificates)

The following permits capture **backend-specific hypotheses** that are required by particular metatheorems. Unlike the universal interfaces (8.1–8.15), these permits encode deep theorems from specific mathematical domains (e.g., dispersive PDE, dynamical systems, algebraic geometry) that cannot be derived from the generic interface structure alone.

:::{prf:definition} Critical Index and Critical Phase Space
:label: def-critical-index

A type $T$ with Scaling Interface data ({prf:ref}`def-interface-sclambda`) specifies:
1. A scaling action $\rho_\lambda$ on thin states $\mathcal{X}$, and
2. A scale family of control seminorms $\{\|\cdot\|_s\}_{s \in \mathcal{S}}$ declared by the type
   (for PDE this is typically Sobolev $s$, but for non-PDE types it may be a spectral,
   complexity, or filtration index).

The **critical index** $s_c$ is any $s$ such that the control norm is scale-invariant:

$$
\|\rho_\lambda u\|_{s_c} = \|u\|_{s_c} \quad \text{for all admissible } \lambda.
$$

The **critical phase space** $X_c$ is the completion of thin states under $\|\cdot\|_{s_c}$.

**Certification note:** If the scale family $\{\|\cdot\|_s\}$ is not declared or the
invariance check cannot be certified, then $s_c$ is **undefined** and any statement
depending on $s_c$ is conditional on the scaling-data certificate.

1. (**Local existence**) For every $u_0 \in X_c$ there exists $T(u_0) > 0$ and a solution $u \in C([0,T]; X_c)$.
2. (**Uniqueness**) The solution is unique in the specified solution class.
3. (**Continuous dependence**) The data-to-solution map is continuous (or Lipschitz) on bounded sets in $X_c$.
4. (**Continuation criterion**) If $T_{\max} < \infty$ then a specified *critical control norm* blows up:

   $$\|u\|_{S([0, T_{\max}))} = \infty \quad (\text{for a declared control norm } S).$$

with:
1. (**Asymptotic orthogonality**) The parameters $(g_n^j)$ are pairwise orthogonal in the standard sense for $G$.
2. (**Decoupling**) Conserved quantities/energies decouple across profiles up to $o_n(1)$ errors.

2. (**Almost periodicity**) The orbit $\{u^*(t)\}$ is precompact in $X_c$ modulo $G$ ("almost periodic mod $G$").
3. (**Long-time perturbation**) A stability lemma: any approximate solution close in the control norm remains close to an exact solution globally on the interval.

**Question:** Does the semiflow $(S_t)_{t\ge0}$ admit a *structural decomposition* of the global attractor sufficient to classify all bounded complete trajectories into equilibria and connecting orbits (or other explicitly described recurrent pieces)?

where the payload asserts one of the following **declared structure types** (choose one and commit to it in the theorem that uses this permit):

**(A) Gradient-like / Lyapunov structure backend:**
- There exists a continuous strict Lyapunov function $L:X\to\mathbb R$ such that:
  1. $t\mapsto L(S_t x)$ is strictly decreasing unless $x$ is an equilibrium;
  2. the set of equilibria $\mathcal E$ is compact (often finite/mod-$G$);
  3. every bounded complete trajectory has $\alpha$- and $\omega$-limits contained in $\mathcal E$.
- **Classification payload:** every bounded complete trajectory is an equilibrium or a heteroclinic connection between equilibria; no periodic orbits occur.

**(B) Morse–Smale backend (stronger, if you want it):**
- The flow on $\mathcal A$ is Morse–Smale (hyperbolic equilibria/periodic orbits, transverse invariant manifolds, no complicated recurrence).
- **Classification payload:** $\mathcal A$ is a finite union of invariant sets (equilibria and possibly finitely many periodic orbits) plus their stable/unstable manifolds; every trajectory converges to one of the basic pieces.

**(C) Conley–Morse decomposition backend (most general/topological):**
- There exists a finite Morse decomposition $\{\mathcal M_i\}_{i=1}^N$ of $\mathcal A$ with a partial order $\preceq$ such that:
  1. each $\mathcal M_i$ is isolated invariant;
  2. every full trajectory in $\mathcal A$ either lies in some $\mathcal M_i$ or connects from $\mathcal M_i$ to $\mathcal M_j$ with $i\succ j$;
  3. the chain recurrent set is contained in $\bigcup_i \mathcal M_i$.
- **Classification payload:** bounded dynamics reduce to membership in one of the Morse sets plus connecting orbits; recurrent behavior is completely captured by the declared Morse sets.

**Used by:** `mt-auto-profile` Mechanism B (Attr+Morse), anywhere you claim "all bounded trajectories are equilibria/heteroclinic/periodic" or a finite Morse decomposition of $\mathcal A$.

### 19.A. The Kernel Objects: Interface Implementations

:::{div} feynman-prose

So far we have listed all the gates - all the questions the Sieve can ask. But where does the data come from to answer these questions?

That is what the kernel objects provide. A Hypostructure has exactly four pieces of core data:

1. **The State Object** $\mathcal{X}$ - Where can the system be? This is the arena.
2. **The Height Object** $\Phi$ - How do we measure progress or cost? This is the potential.
3. **The Dissipation Object** $\mathfrak{D}$ - How fast is energy being lost? This is the friction.
4. **The Symmetry Object** $G$ - What transformations leave the physics unchanged? This is the invariance.

Everything else is derived from these four. The interfaces are like projections - each one reaches into the kernel objects, extracts the data it needs, and computes its verdict.

Think of it like a compiler: you write source code (the four kernel objects), and the compiler (the Sieve) generates machine code (the interface evaluators) automatically. You do not have to write the evaluators yourself.

:::

A Hypostructure $\mathcal{H} = (\mathcal{X}, \Phi, \mathfrak{D}, G)$ consists of four **kernel objects**. Each kernel object implements a subset of the interfaces defined in Sections 19.1-19.15.

This section specifies each kernel object using a standardized template:
1. **Component Table**: Maps each internal component to its mathematical type, the interface it satisfies, and its role in the Sieve
2. **Formal Definition**: Tuple specification with implementation constraints and domain examples

This serves as a "header file" for instantiation - users can read the table and know exactly what data structures to provide for their domain.

### 19.B. The Instantiation Metatheorem

:::{prf:theorem} [FACT-ValidInst] Valid Instantiation
:label: mt-fact-valid-inst

**Statement:** To instantiate a Hypostructure for a system $S$ of type $T$ is to provide:
1. An ambient $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathcal{E}$ (or a 1-topos/category with sufficient structure)
2. Concrete implementations $(\mathcal{X}, \Phi, \mathfrak{D}, G)$ satisfying the specifications of {ref}`sec-kernel-objects`
3. For each relevant interface $I \in \{\text{Reg}^0, \text{D}^0, \ldots, \text{Lock}^0\}$:
   - The required structure $\mathcal{D}_I$ from the interface definition
   - A computable predicate $\mathcal{P}_I$ evaluating to $\{\text{YES}, \text{NO}, \text{Blocked}\}$ with typed NO certificates ($K^{\mathrm{wit}}$ or $K^{\mathrm{inc}}$)
   - Certificate schemas $\mathcal{K}_I^+$, $\mathcal{K}_I^{\mathrm{wit}}$, and $\mathcal{K}_I^{\mathrm{inc}}$

**Consequence:** Upon valid instantiation, the Sieve Algorithm becomes a well-defined computable function:

$$\text{Sieve}: \text{Instance}(\mathcal{H}) \to \text{Result}$$

where $\text{Result} \in \{\text{GlobalRegularity}, \text{Mode}_{1..15}, \text{FatalError}\}$. NO-inconclusive certificates route to reconstruction rather than terminating as a separate outcome.

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Each kernel object is defined in $\mathcal{E}$
- [ ] Each interface's required structure is provided
- [ ] Predicates are computable (or semi-decidable with timeout)
- [ ] Certificate schemas are well-formed
- [ ] Type $T$ is specified from the catalog ({prf:ref}`def-problem-type`)

:::{prf:theorem} [FACT-MinInst] Minimal Instantiation
:label: mt-fact-min-inst

**Statement:** To instantiate a Hypostructure for system $S$ using the **thin object** formalism ({ref}`sec-thin-kernel-objects`), the user provides only:

1. **The Space** $\mathcal{X}$ and its geometry (metric $d$, measure $\mu$)
2. **The Energy** $\Phi$ and its scaling $\alpha$
3. **The Dissipation** $\mathfrak{D}$ and its scaling $\beta$
4. **The Symmetry Group** $G$ with action $\rho$ and scaling subgroup $\mathcal{S}$

**The Framework (Sieve) automatically derives:**
1. **Profiles:** Via Universal Profile Trichotomy ({prf:ref}`mt-resolve-profile`)
2. **Admissibility:** Via Surgery Admissibility Predicate ({prf:ref}`mt-resolve-admissibility`)
3. **Regularization:** Via Structural Surgery Operator ({prf:ref}`mt-act-surgery`)
4. **Topology:** Via persistent homology on measure $\mu$
5. **Bad Sets:** Via concentration locus of $\mathfrak{D}$

**User vs Framework Responsibility Matrix:**

| Task | User Provides | Framework Derives |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| Singularity Detection | Energy scaling $\alpha$ | Profile $V$ via scaling group |
| Stability Analysis | Gradient $\nabla$ | Stiffness $\theta$ via Łojasiewicz |
| Surgery Construction | Measure $\mu$ | SurgeryOperator if Cap$(\Sigma)$ small |
| Topology | Space $\mathcal{X}$ | Sectors via $\pi_0$ |
| Bad Set | Dissipation $R$ | $\Sigma = \{x: R(x) \to \infty\}$ |
| Profile Library | Symmetry $G$ | Canonical library via moduli |

**Consequence:** The full instantiation of MT {prf:ref}`mt-fact-valid-inst` is achieved by the **Thin-to-Full Expansion** (MT {prf:ref}`mt-resolve-expansion`), reducing user burden from ~30 components to 10 primitive inputs.

### 19.C Thin Kernel Objects

:::{div} feynman-prose

Now here is the punchline of this whole section.

You might look at all those kernel objects with their dozens of components and think: "This is going to be a nightmare to instantiate. I have to provide all that structure myself?"

No. You provide the essentials - just 10 pieces of data - and the framework derives everything else automatically.

This is the thin-to-full expansion. You tell us:
- What space your system lives in (and how to measure distance in it)
- What quantity you are trying to minimize (and how it scales)
- How fast energy dissipates (and how that scales)
- What symmetries your system has

From these primitives, the Sieve constructs the full apparatus: the bad sets, the profiles, the surgery operators, the topological sectors. You do not have to be an expert in concentration-compactness or o-minimal geometry. You just describe your system, and the machinery figures out how to analyze it.

This is what makes the framework actually usable in practice.

:::

**Design Principle:** The full Kernel Objects of {ref}`sec-kernel-objects` contain both *structural data* (user-provided) and *algorithmic machinery* (Framework-derived). This section extracts the **minimal user burden** - the "thin" objects that users must specify. Everything else is automatically constructed by the Sieve via the Universal Singularity Modules ({prf:ref}`mt-resolve-profile`, {prf:ref}`mt-resolve-admissibility`, {prf:ref}`mt-act-surgery`).

:::{prf:remark} Minimal Instantiation Burden
:label: rem-minimal-burden

To instantiate a Hypostructure, the user provides exactly **10 primitive components**:

| Object | Components | Physical Meaning |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| $\mathcal{X}^{\text{thin}}$ | $\mathcal{X}, d, \mu$ | "Where does the system live?" |
| $\Phi^{\text{thin}}$ | $F, \nabla, \alpha$ | "What is being minimized?" |
| $\mathfrak{D}^{\text{thin}}$ | $R, \beta$ | "How fast does energy dissipate?" |
| $G^{\text{thin}}$ | Grp, $\rho, \mathcal{S}$ | "What symmetries does the system have?" |

The **full Kernel Objects** of {ref}`sec-kernel-objects` are then constructed automatically:

$$\mathcal{H}^{\text{full}} = \text{Expand}(\mathcal{X}^{\text{thin}}, \Phi^{\text{thin}}, \mathfrak{D}^{\text{thin}}, G^{\text{thin}})$$

This expansion is performed by the **Universal Singularity Modules** ({prf:ref}`mt-resolve-profile`, {prf:ref}`mt-resolve-admissibility`, {prf:ref}`mt-act-surgery`), which implement the `ProfileExtractor` and `SurgeryOperator` interfaces as metatheorems rather than user-provided code.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} [RESOLVE-Expansion] Thin-to-Full Expansion
:label: mt-resolve-expansion

Given thin objects $(\mathcal{X}^{\text{thin}}, \Phi^{\text{thin}}, \mathfrak{D}^{\text{thin}}, G^{\text{thin}})$, the Framework automatically constructs:

1. **Topological Structure:**
   - SectorMap $\leftarrow \pi_0(\mathcal{X})$
   - Dictionary $\leftarrow \dim(\mathcal{X}) + $ type signature

2. **Singularity Detection:**
   - $\mathcal{X}_{\text{bad}} \leftarrow \{x : R(x) \to \infty\}$
   - $\Sigma \leftarrow \text{support of singular measure}$

3. **Profile Classification** ({prf:ref}`mt-resolve-profile`):
   - ProfileExtractor $\leftarrow$ scaling group orbit analysis
   - Canonical library $\leftarrow$ moduli space computation

4. **Surgery Construction** ({prf:ref}`mt-act-surgery`):
   - SurgeryOperator $\leftarrow$ pushout along excision
   - Admissibility $\leftarrow$ capacity bounds from $\mu$

**Guarantee:** If the thin objects satisfy basic consistency (metric is complete, $F$ is lower semicontinuous, $R \geq 0$, $\rho$ is continuous), then the expansion produces valid full Kernel Objects.

### 19.19. Soft-to-Backend Compilation

:::{div} feynman-prose

Here is the final piece of the automation puzzle.

Some of the permits we need are genuinely hard to verify. Well-posedness theory for PDEs. Profile decomposition theorems. Rigidity results for minimal counterexamples. These are deep theorems that took decades of research to establish.

But here is the thing: for "good types" (systems that match known patterns), these theorems have already been proved. Semilinear parabolic equations have well-posedness in energy spaces. Critical dispersive equations have profile decomposition. And so on.

So instead of asking the user to re-prove these theorems for their specific system, we build a compiler. The compiler looks at the soft interfaces the user provided, matches them against a database of known theorem templates, and automatically emits the backend permits.

You give us energy bounds and scaling exponents. We give you well-posedness certificates. You give us symmetry groups and compactness properties. We give you profile decomposition and rigidity theorems.

This is how the framework achieves practical automation: by standing on the shoulders of existing mathematical knowledge.

:::

This section defines the **compilation layer** that automatically derives backend permits from soft interfaces for good types. Users implement only soft interfaces; the framework derives WP, ProfDec, KM, Rigidity, etc.

For **good types** (satisfying the Automation Guarantee), soft interface verification **automatically discharges** backend permits via compilation metatheorems.



:::{prf:theorem} [FACT-SoftWP] Soft-to-WP Compilation
:label: mt-fact-soft-wp

**Statement:** For good types $T$ satisfying the Automation Guarantee, critical well-posedness is derived from soft interfaces.

**Soft Hypotheses:**

$$K_{\mathcal{H}_0}^+ \wedge K_{D_E}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{Bound}}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{Rep}_K}^+$$

**Produces:**

$$K_{\mathrm{WP}_{s_c}}^+$$

**Mechanism (Template Matching):**
The evaluator `Eval_WP(T)` checks whether $T$ matches a known well-posedness template:

| Template | Soft Signature | WP Theorem Applied |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| Semilinear parabolic | $D_E^+$ (coercive) + $\mathrm{Bound}^+$ (Dirichlet/Neumann) | Energy-space LWP |
| Semilinear wave | $\mathrm{SC}_\lambda^+$ (finite speed) + $\mathrm{Bound}^+$ | Strichartz estimates |
| Semilinear Schrödinger | $\mathrm{SC}_\lambda^+$ + $D_E^+$ (conservation) | Dispersive estimates |
| Symmetric hyperbolic | $\mathrm{Rep}_K^+$ (finite description) | Friedrichs method |

**Certificate Emitted:**
$K_{\mathrm{WP}_{s_c}}^+ = (\mathsf{template\_ID}, \mathsf{theorem\_citation}, s_c, \mathsf{continuation\_criterion})$

**NO-Inconclusive Case:** If $T$ matches no template, emit $K_{\mathrm{WP}}^{\mathrm{inc}}$ with $\mathsf{failure\_code} = \texttt{TEMPLATE\_MISS}$. The user may supply a WP proof manually or extend the template database.

:::{prf:theorem} Soft-to-Backend Completeness
:label: thm-soft-backend-complete

**Statement:** For good types $T$ satisfying the Automation Guarantee, all backend permits are derived from soft interfaces.

$$\underbrace{K_{D_E}^+ \wedge K_{C_\mu}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{Rep}_K}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{Mon}_\phi}^+}_{\text{Soft Layer (User Provides)}}$$

$$\Downarrow \text{Compilation}$$

$$\underbrace{K_{\mathrm{WP}}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{ProfDec}}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{KM}}^+ \wedge K_{\mathrm{Rigidity}}^+}_{\text{Backend Layer (Framework Derives)}}$$

**Consequence:** The public signature of `mt-auto-profile` requires only soft interfaces. Backend permits appear only in the **internal compilation proof**, not in the user-facing hypotheses.

#### 19.19.2 Evaluators for Derived Permits

The Sieve implements proof-producing evaluators for each derived permit. Every evaluator returns a binary YES/NO verdict with typed certificates:

| Evaluator | Input | YES Output | NO Output | Template Database |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `Eval_WP(T)` | Type $T$, soft certs | $K_{\mathrm{WP}}^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{WP}}^{\mathrm{wit}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{WP}}^{\mathrm{inc}}$ | Semilinear parabolic, wave, Schrödinger, hyperbolic |
| `Eval_ProfDec(T)` | Type $T$, $C_\mu^+$, $\mathrm{SC}_\lambda^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{ProfDec}}^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{ProfDec}}^{\mathrm{wit}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{ProfDec}}^{\mathrm{inc}}$ | Hilbert space + standard symmetry |
| `Eval_KM(T)` | $\mathrm{WP}^+$, $\mathrm{ProfDec}^+$, $D_E^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{KM}}^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{KM}}^{\mathrm{wit}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{KM}}^{\mathrm{inc}}$ | Composition (no template needed) |
| `Eval_Rigidity(T)` | $\mathrm{Mon}^+$, $\mathrm{KM}^+$, $\mathrm{LS}^+$, Lock | $K_{\mathrm{Rigidity}}^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{Rigidity}}^{\mathrm{wit}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{Rigidity}}^{\mathrm{inc}}$ | Hybrid mechanism |
| `Eval_Attr(T)` | $D_E^+$, $C_\mu^+$, $\mathrm{TB}_\pi^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{Attr}}^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{Attr}}^{\mathrm{wit}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{Attr}}^{\mathrm{inc}}$ | Temam-Raugel theorem |
| `Eval_MorseDecomp(T)` | $\mathrm{Attr}^+$, $D_E^+$, $\mathrm{LS}^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{MorseDecomp}}^+$ | $K_{\mathrm{MorseDecomp}}^{\mathrm{wit}}$ or $K_{\mathrm{MorseDecomp}}^{\mathrm{inc}}$ | Gradient-like / Morse-Smale |

**NO-Inconclusive Policy:** If no template matches, the evaluator returns NO with $K_P^{\mathrm{inc}}$ (not a semantic refutation). The user may then:
1. Supply the backend permit manually (escape hatch)
2. Add a new template to the database
3. Accept that the type is "non-good" and requires custom proof

**Routing on NO Certificates:** The Sieve branches on certificate type:
- **NO with $K^{\mathrm{wit}}$**: Fatal route—a genuine counterexample exists
- **NO with $K^{\mathrm{inc}}$**: Reconstruction route—try adding interfaces, refining library, or extending templates



:::{prf:theorem} [FACT-GermDensity] Germ Set Density
:label: mt-fact-germ-density

**Rigor Class:** F (Framework-Original)

**Sieve Target:** Node 17 (Lock) — ensures the finite library suffices

**Statement:** Let $\mathcal{G}_T$ be the small germ set for problem type $T$, and let $\mathcal{B} = \{B_i\}_{i \in I}$ be the finite Bad Pattern Library from Interface $\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}$. Then $\mathcal{B}$ is **dense** in $\mathbb{H}_{\mathrm{bad}}^{(T)}$ in the following sense:

For any germ $[P, \pi] \in \mathcal{G}_T$, there exists $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$ and a factorization:

$$\mathbb{H}_{[P,\pi]} \to B_i \to \mathbb{H}_{\mathrm{bad}}^{(T)}$$

**Consequence:** If $\mathrm{Hom}(B_i, \mathbb{H}(Z)) = \emptyset$ for all $B_i \in \mathcal{B}$, then $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{H}_{\mathrm{bad}}^{(T)}, \mathbb{H}(Z)) = \emptyset$.

**Certificate Produced:** $K_{\mathrm{density}}^+ := (\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{G}_T, \text{factorization witnesses}, \text{type-specific completeness})$
