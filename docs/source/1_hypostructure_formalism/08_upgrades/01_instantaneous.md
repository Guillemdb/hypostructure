## Instantaneous Certificate Upgrades

The **Instantaneous Upgrade Metatheorems** formalize the logical principle that a "Blocked" barrier certificate or a "Surgery" re-entry certificate can be promoted to a full **YES** (or **YES$^\sim$**) permit under appropriate structural conditions. These upgrades occur *within* a single Sieve pass when the blocking condition itself implies a stronger regularity guarantee.

**Logical Form:** $K_{\text{Node}}^- \wedge K_{\text{Barrier}}^{\mathrm{blk}} \Rightarrow K_{\text{Node}}^{\sim}$

The key insight is that certain "obstructions" are themselves *certificates of regularity* when viewed from the correct perspective.

:::{div} feynman-prose
Now here is something that might seem paradoxical at first, but once you see it, you will never forget it. The Sieve runs through its diagnostic nodes, and sometimes a node says "NO"---energy is infinite, events are piling up, something looks bad. You might think, well, that is the end of the story. The system fails the check.

But wait. The barrier that stopped you---the very thing that said "you cannot pass this way"---sometimes contains exactly the information you need to prove everything is fine after all.

Think of it like this. Suppose you are trying to prove a particle will not escape to infinity. Your first check says "energy is unbounded!" That sounds terrible. But then you look more carefully at what blocked you: the barrier certificate says the system has a drift condition pushing it back toward the center. And this drift condition is precisely what guarantees the particle keeps returning---it cannot escape. The obstruction was the proof all along.

This is what the upgrade theorems capture: the logical judo of turning a "blocked" verdict into a "yes, but in a different sense" permit. The $K^{\sim}$ superscript means "yes, under a suitable reinterpretation"---renormalized measure, effective scaling, removable singularity, whatever the physics requires.

The beautiful thing is that these upgrades happen instantly, within a single pass through the Sieve. You do not need to iterate or wait for more information. The barrier certificate already contains everything you need.

### Saturation Promotion

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me tell you what saturation really means. You have a system---say, a noisy oscillator---and you measure its energy. It looks infinite! The energy functional blows up. First instinct: panic. The system is unstable, unbounded, a disaster.

But look at what the saturation barrier is telling you: yes, the energy is formally infinite, but there is a drift pushing the system back. The generator $\mathcal{L}$ applied to the height $\Phi$ is negative (up to a bounded correction). This is the Foster-Lyapunov condition, and it is a remarkable thing. It says: no matter how far out you go, the dynamics are always pulling you back toward the center.

The key insight from Meyn and Tweedie is that this drift condition guarantees a unique invariant measure $\pi$ exists, and under this measure, the expected height is finite. So the "infinite energy" was an artifact of looking at the wrong reference frame. Change your measure to the equilibrium distribution, and suddenly everything is finite.

This is the first example of the upgrade pattern: what looks like a failure is actually success in disguise. The barrier certificate *is* the proof of regularity---you just have to read it correctly.

3. A cosmic censorship condition: the singular set $\Sigma$ is contained in the future boundary $\mathcal{I}^+ \cup i^+$ of conformally compactified spacetime.

**Statement:** If the singularity is hidden behind an event horizon or lies at future null/timelike infinity, it is causally inaccessible to any physical observer. The event count is finite relative to any observer worldline $\gamma$ with finite proper time.

:::{prf:proof}

By the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (Penrose, 1969), generic gravitational collapse produces singularities cloaked by event horizons. The Hawking-Penrose theorems (1970) establish geodesic incompleteness, but the Christodoulou-Klainerman stability theorem (1993) ensures the exterior remains regular. Any observer worldline $\gamma \subset J^-(\mathcal{I}^+)$ experiences finite proper time and finite events before the singularity becomes causally relevant.

(sec-scattering-promotion)=
### Scattering Promotion

:::{div} feynman-prose
Scattering is one of the most beautiful ideas in the analysis of nonlinear waves. Here is the picture to keep in your mind.

You have a wave---maybe it is a solution to a nonlinear Schrodinger equation---and it is doing complicated things. Peaks form, interact, maybe they look like they are about to focus into a singularity. The CompactCheck says "no concentration"---the wave is spreading out rather than piling up at a point.

Now, you might think this is bad news. No concentration means no nice compact profile to characterize. But here is the judo move: if the wave is not concentrating, it must be dispersing. And if it is dispersing with finite Morawetz quantity (a spacetime integral that measures interaction), then asymptotically it becomes a free wave. All the nonlinear complications wash away, and what remains is just the linear Schrodinger evolution plus a fixed scattering state.

This is the VICTORY condition---the strongest possible outcome. Not merely "no singularity" but "the solution exists globally and approaches something simple as $t \to \pm\infty$." The Kenig-Merle methodology makes this rigorous: either the solution concentrates (and we analyze the profile), or it scatters (and we are done). The Morawetz estimate rules out the pathological in-between.

What I want you to appreciate is how the "failure" of concentration---the NO from CompactCheck---directly implies scattering. The barrier said "no profile here," and that is precisely why the wave must disperse to infinity.

**Bridge Verification:**
1. *Hypothesis Translation:* Certificate $K_{C_\mu}^{\mathrm{ben}}$ implies: (a) finite Morawetz quantity $\int_0^\infty \int |x|^{-1}|u|^{p+1} < \infty$, (b) no concentration sequence
2. *Domain Embedding:* $\iota: \mathbf{Hypo}_T \to H^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for dispersive NLS/NLW with critical Sobolev exponent
3. *Conclusion Import:* Morawetz {cite}`Morawetz68` + Strichartz + Kenig-Merle rigidity {cite}`KenigMerle06` $\Rightarrow$ Global Regularity (scattering to linear solution)

**Context:** Node 3 (CompactCheck) fails (No concentration), but BarrierScat indicates Benign ($K_{C_\mu}^{\mathrm{ben}}$).

**Hypotheses.** Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hypostructure of type $T_{\text{dispersive}}$ with:
1. A dispersive evolution $u(t)$ satisfying a nonlinear wave or Schrödinger equation
2. The concentration-compactness dichotomy: either $\mu(V) > 0$ for some profile $V$, or dispersion dominates
3. A finite Morawetz quantity: $\int_0^\infty \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |x|^{-1} |u|^{p+1} \, dx \, dt < \infty$

**Statement:** If energy disperses (no concentration) and the interaction functional is finite (Morawetz bound), the solution scatters to a free linear state: there exists $u_\pm \in H^1$ such that $\|u(t) - e^{it\Delta}u_\pm\|_{H^1} \to 0$ as $t \to \pm\infty$. This is a "Victory" condition equivalent to global existence and regularity.

:::

:::{prf:proof}

*Step 1 (Morawetz Spacetime Bound).* The **Morawetz estimate** ({cite}`Morawetz68`) provides spacetime integrability:

$$\int_0^\infty \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{|u(t,x)|^{p+1}}{|x|} \, dx \, dt \leq C \cdot E[u_0]$$

This "spacetime Lebesgue norm" is finite for solutions with bounded energy, ruling out mass concentration at the origin over long times.

*Step 2 (Strichartz Estimates).* The **Strichartz estimates** ({cite}`Strichartz77`; {cite}`KeelTao98` Theorem 1.2) provide:

$$\|e^{it\Delta} u_0\|_{L^q_t L^r_x} \leq C \|u_0\|_{L^2}$$

for admissible pairs $(q, r)$ satisfying $\frac{2}{q} + \frac{n}{r} = \frac{n}{2}$. These estimates control the spacetime norm of solutions in terms of initial data, enabling the perturbative argument below.

*Step 3 (Concentration-Compactness Rigidity).* By the **Kenig-Merle methodology** ({cite}`KenigMerle06` Theorem 1.1), if $K_{C_\mu}^- = \text{NO}$ (no concentration), then either:
- (a) Solution scatters: $\|u(t) - e^{it\Delta} u_\pm\|_{H^1} \to 0$, or
- (b) A critical element exists with zero Morawetz norm—but this contradicts the Morawetz bound from Step 1.

*Step 4 (Scattering Construction).* The limiting profile $u_\pm$ is constructed via the **Cook method**: define $u_\pm := \lim_{t \to \pm\infty} e^{-it\Delta} u(t)$. The limit exists in $H^1$ by Strichartz + Morawetz: the integral $\int_0^\infty \|N(u)\|_{L^{r'}_x} dt$ is finite, where $N(u)$ is the nonlinearity.

**Hypotheses.** Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hypostructure with:
1. A supercritical scaling exponent $\alpha > \alpha_c$ (energy-supercritical regime)
2. A Type II blow-up scenario where the solution concentrates at a point with unbounded $L^\infty$ norm but bounded energy
3. An energy monotonicity formula $\frac{d}{dt}\mathcal{E}_\lambda(t) \leq 0$ for the localized energy at scale $\lambda$

**Statement:** If the renormalization cost $\int_0^{T^*} \lambda(t)^{-\gamma} \, dt = \infty$ diverges logarithmically, the supercritical singularity is suppressed and cannot form in finite time. The blow-up rate satisfies $\lambda(t) \geq c(T^* - t)^{1/\gamma}$ for some $\gamma > 0$.

:::

:::{prf:proof}

The monotonicity formula (Merle and Zaag, 1998) bounds the blow-up rate from below. For Type II blow-up, the energy remains bounded while the scale $\lambda(t) \to 0$. The logarithmic divergence of the renormalization integral creates an energy barrier that prevents finite-time singularity formation. This mechanism underlies the Raphaël-Szeftel soliton resolution (2011).

2. A capacity bound: $\mathrm{Cap}_{1,2}(\Sigma) = 0$ where $\mathrm{Cap}_{1,2}$ is the $(1,2)$-capacity (Sobolev capacity)
3. The solution $u \in H^1_{\text{loc}}(\mathcal{X} \setminus \Sigma)$

**Statement:** If the singular set has zero capacity (even if its Hausdorff dimension is large), it is removable for the $H^1$ energy class. There exists a unique extension $\tilde{u} \in H^1(\mathcal{X})$ with $\tilde{u}|_{\mathcal{X} \setminus \Sigma} = u$.

By Federer's theorem on removable singularities (1969, Section 4.7), sets of zero $(1,p)$-capacity are removable for $W^{1,p}$ functions.

**Hypotheses.** Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hypostructure with:
1. A linearized operator $L = D^2\Phi(x^*)$ at a critical point $x^*$
2. A spectral gap: $\lambda_1(L) > 0$ (smallest nonzero eigenvalue is positive)
3. The nonlinear flow $\partial_t x = -\nabla \Phi(x)$ near $x^*$

**Statement:** If a spectral gap $\lambda_1 > 0$ exists, the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality automatically holds with optimal exponent $\theta = 1/2$. The convergence rate is exponential: $\|x(t) - x^*\| \leq Ce^{-\lambda_1 t/2}$.

:::{prf:proof}

The Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality states $|\Phi(x) - \Phi(x^*)|^{1-\theta} \leq C\|\nabla\Phi(x)\|$ for some $\theta \in (0,1/2]$. When the Hessian is non-degenerate ($\lambda_1 > 0$), Taylor expansion gives $\theta = 1/2$. The exponential convergence then follows from the Gronwall inequality applied to the energy functional. See Simon (1983, Theorem 3) and Feehan and Maridakis (2019).
:::



(sec-o-minimal-promotion)=
### O-Minimal Promotion

:::{div} feynman-prose
O-minimality is one of those concepts that sounds technical but captures something deeply intuitive: tame sets cannot be pathologically complicated.

What do I mean by "tame"? Consider the real numbers with the usual operations of addition and multiplication. Any set you can define using polynomial equations and inequalities is "semialgebraic." These sets are nice---they have finitely many connected components, no fractal boundaries, no wild oscillations. Tarski proved that the theory of real closed fields is decidable precisely because semialgebraic sets are so well-behaved.

O-minimal structures extend this to include things like exponentials and analytic functions, while preserving the tameness. The key property is: every definable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is a finite union of points and intervals. No Cantor sets, no pathological examples from real analysis.

Why does this matter for singularities? If your dynamics and your singular set are both definable in an o-minimal structure, then the singular set cannot be fractal or have infinitely complicated topology. The cell decomposition theorem says it breaks into finitely many smooth pieces. The Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality says gradient descent must converge in finite arc-length---no infinite spiraling.

So when the TameCheck says "WILD" but we know the set is o-minimal, we have an immediate upgrade. The "wildness" was a failure of the generic check to recognize a structured special case. Once we invoke o-minimality, the cell decomposition theorem guarantees tameness.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} [UP-OMinimal] O-Minimal Promotion (BarrierOmin $\to$ YES$^\sim$)
:label: mt-up-o-minimal

**Context:** Node 9 (TameCheck) fails (Wild), but BarrierOmin is Blocked ($K_{\mathrm{TB}_O}^{\mathrm{blk}}$).

**Hypotheses.** Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hypostructure with:
1. A singular/wild set $W \subset \mathcal{X}$ that is a priori not regular
2. Definability: $W$ is definable in an o-minimal expansion of $(\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)$ (e.g., $\mathbb{R}_{\text{an,exp}}$)
3. The dynamics are generated by a definable vector field

**Statement:** If the wild set is definable in an o-minimal structure, it admits a finite Whitney stratification into smooth manifolds. The set is topologically tame: it has finite Betti numbers, satisfies the curve selection lemma, and admits no pathological embeddings.

**Certificate Logic:**

$$K_{\mathrm{TB}_O}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{TB}_O}^{\mathrm{blk}} \Rightarrow K_{\mathrm{TB}_O}^{\sim}$$

**Interface Permit Validated:** Tame Topology.

**Literature:** {cite}`vandenDries98` Ch.3 (cell decomposition, uniform finiteness); {cite}`Kurdyka98` Thm.1 (KL inequality); {cite}`Wilkie96` (model completeness)
:::

:::{prf:proof}

*Step 1 (Cell Decomposition).* By the **cell decomposition theorem** ({cite}`vandenDries98` Theorem 3.2.11), every definable set $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ in an o-minimal structure admits a finite partition:

$$W = \bigsqcup_{i=1}^N C_i$$

where each $C_i$ is a **definable cell**—a set homeomorphic to $(0,1)^{d_i}$ for some $d_i \leq n$. The cells are smooth manifolds with boundary, and the partition is canonical.

*Step 2 (Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz Gradient Inequality).* For any definable function $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ in an o-minimal structure, the **Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequality** ({cite}`Kurdyka98` Theorem 1) holds near critical points:

$$\|\nabla(\psi \circ \Phi)(x)\| \geq 1 \quad \text{for some desingularizing function } \psi$$

This guarantees gradient descent converges in finite arc-length, preventing infinite oscillation. Combined with Step 1, trajectories cross finitely many cell boundaries.

*Step 3 (Uniform Finiteness + Tame Topology).* The **uniform finiteness theorem** ({cite}`vandenDries98` Theorem 3.4.4) bounds topological complexity: $\dim(W) \leq n$, $b_k(W) < \infty$ for all Betti numbers, and $W$ contains no pathological embeddings (wild arcs, horned spheres). This establishes the tame topology permit.
:::



(sec-surgery-promotion)=
### Surgery Promotion

:::{div} feynman-prose
Surgery is the nuclear option. Everything else has failed---the node said NO, the barrier could not block the singularity, and the flow is about to develop a genuine blowup. What do you do?

You cut out the bad part and sew in something clean.

This sounds drastic, and it is. But here is the remarkable thing that Hamilton discovered and Perelman made precise: if you know the geometry of the singularity, you know exactly how to cut. Near a high-curvature point, the manifold always looks like one of a small number of standard models---a shrinking sphere, a cylinder, or a Bryant soliton. This is the Canonical Neighborhood Theorem, and it is what makes surgery well-defined rather than arbitrary.

Think of it like this. A surgeon removing a tumor does not cut randomly. They cut along anatomical boundaries, excising the pathological tissue while preserving the healthy structure. The canonical neighborhood theorem tells us exactly where those boundaries are in Ricci flow: the singularity has a standard local form, so the excision and capping procedure is essentially unique.

The re-entry certificate $K^{\mathrm{re}}$ says: "I performed a valid surgery. The excised set had small capacity (I did not remove too much), the inserted cap matches the canonical geometry, and the height decreased (so we made progress)." With this certificate, the flow can continue on the modified manifold.

What I find philosophically interesting is that surgery is an admission that smooth solutions do not exist---but it is a controlled admission. We get a generalized solution that is smooth except at finitely many surgery times, and this is often good enough to extract topological or physical conclusions.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} [UP-Surgery] Surgery Promotion (Surgery $\to$ YES$^\sim$)
:label: mt-up-surgery

**Context:** Any Node fails, Barrier breached, but Surgery $S$ executes and issues re-entry certificate ($K^{\mathrm{re}}$).

**Hypotheses.** Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hypostructure with:
1. A singularity at $(t^*, x^*) \in \mathcal{X}$ with modal diagnosis $M \in \{C.E, C.C, \ldots, B.C\}$
2. A valid surgery operator $\mathcal{O}_S: (\mathcal{X}, \Phi) \to (\mathcal{X}', \Phi')$ satisfying:
   - Admissibility: singular profile $V \in \mathcal{L}_T$ (canonical library)
   - Capacity bound: $\mathrm{Cap}(\text{excision}) \leq \varepsilon_{\text{adm}}$
   - Progress: $\Phi'(x') \leq \Phi(x) - \delta_S$ (height decrease)

**Statement:** If a valid surgery is performed, the flow continues on the modified Hypostructure $\mathcal{H}'$. The combined flow (pre-surgery on $\mathcal{X}$, post-surgery on $\mathcal{X}'$) constitutes a generalized (surgery/weak) solution.

**Certificate Logic:**

$$K_{\text{Node}}^- \wedge K_{\text{Surg}}^{\mathrm{re}} \Rightarrow K_{\text{Node}}^{\sim} \quad (\text{on } \mathcal{X}')$$

**Canonical Neighborhoods (Uniqueness):** The **Canonical Neighborhood Theorem** (Perelman 2003) ensures surgery is essentially unique: near any high-curvature point $p$ with $|Rm|(p) \geq r^{-2}$, the pointed manifold $(M, g, p)$ is $\varepsilon$-close (in the pointed Cheeger-Gromov sense) to one of:
- A round shrinking sphere $S^n / \Gamma$
- A round shrinking cylinder $S^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}$
- A Bryant soliton

This **classification of local models** eliminates surgery ambiguity: the excision location and cap geometry are determined by the canonical structure up to diffeomorphism. Different valid surgery choices yield **diffeomorphic** post-surgery manifolds, making the surgery operation **functorial** in $\mathbf{Bord}_n$.

**Interface Permit Validated:** Global Existence (in the sense of surgery/weak flow).

**Literature:** {cite}`Hamilton97`; {cite}`Perelman03`; {cite}`KleinerLott08`
:::

:::{prf:proof}

The surgery construction follows Hamilton (1997) for Ricci flow and Perelman (2002-2003) for the rigorous completion. The key ingredients are: (1) canonical neighborhood theorem ensuring surgery regions are standard, (2) non-collapsing estimates controlling geometry, (3) finite surgery time theorem bounding the number of surgeries. The post-surgery manifold inherits all regularity properties.

(sec-lock-promotion)=
### Lock Promotion

:::{div} feynman-prose
The Lock is the final guardian. After all the nodes have run, after all the barriers have been tested, after all the local analyses are complete, the Lock asks one global question: can the universal bad pattern embed into this system at all?

Let me explain what this means. Throughout mathematics, we have developed a library of what singularities look like---concentration profiles, blowup rates, scaling behaviors. The "universal bad pattern" $\mathcal{B}_{\text{univ}}$ is the categorical abstraction of all these possibilities. If a singularity of any type were to form, it would manifest as a morphism from this pattern into your system.

Now, the Lock computes the Hom-set $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\text{univ}}, \mathcal{H})$. If this set is empty---if there is no way to map the bad pattern into your hypostructure---then no singularity can exist. Period. The proof is trivial once you set it up correctly: existence of a singularity would imply a morphism, but the Hom-set is empty, contradiction.

This is what Grothendieck called the "yoga of morphisms": instead of proving something does not exist by checking all possible forms it might take, you prove no map can exist. It is a global obstruction that settles everything at once.

When the Lock returns BLOCKED, it validates not just one permit but all permits retroactively. Every earlier ambiguity is resolved in the favorable direction. This is why the Lock is so powerful---it upgrades the entire certificate context in one move.

3. Categorical coherence: all nodes converge to Node 17 with compatible certificates

The proof uses the contrapositive: if a singularity existed, it would generate a non-trivial morphism $\phi: \mathcal{B}_{\text{univ}} \to \mathcal{H}$ by the universal property. The emptiness of the Hom-set is established via cohomological/spectral obstructions (E1-E13 tactics). This is the "Grothendieck yoga" of reducing existence questions to non-existence of maps.

**Statement:** If the flux across the boundary is strictly outgoing (dissipative) and inputs are bounded, the internal energy cannot blow up. The boundary acts as a "heat sink" absorbing energy.

**Certificate Logic:**

$$K_{D_E}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{Bound}_\partial}^+ \wedge (\text{Flux} < 0) \Rightarrow K_{D_E}^{\sim}$$

**Interface Permit Validated:** Finite Energy (via Boundary Dissipation).

**Literature:** {cite}`Dafermos16`; {cite}`DafermosRodnianski10`

:::{prf:proof}

The energy identity is $\frac{dE}{dt} = -\mathfrak{D}(t) + \int_{\partial\Omega} \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dS + \int_\Omega \text{source}(x,t) \, dx$. By hypothesis 3, the flux term satisfies $\int_{\partial\Omega} \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{F} \, dS < 0$ (strictly outgoing). Since dissipation satisfies $\mathfrak{D}(t) \geq 0$, we have:

$$\frac{dE}{dt} \leq \int_\Omega \text{source}(x,t) \, dx \leq \|\text{source}(\cdot, t)\|_{L^1(\Omega)}$$

Integrating from $0$ to $t$ and using hypothesis 4:

$$E(t) \leq E(0) + \int_0^t \|\text{source}(\cdot, s)\|_{L^1(\Omega)} \, ds < \infty$$

This is the energy method of Dafermos (2016, Chapter 5) applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with dissipative boundary conditions.

### Catastrophe Stability Promotion

:::{prf:theorem} [UP-Catastrophe] Catastrophe-Stability Promotion (BifurcateCheck $\to$ StiffnessCheck)
:label: mt-up-catastrophe

**Context:** Node 7 (Stiffness) fails (Flat/Zero Eigenvalue), but Node 7a (Bifurcation) identifies a **Canonical Catastrophe**.

**Hypotheses.** Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a Hypostructure with:
1. A potential $V(x)$ with a degenerate critical point: $V''(x^*) = 0$
2. A canonical catastrophe normal form: $V(x) = x^{k+1}/(k+1)$ for $k \geq 2$ (fold $k=2$, cusp $k=3$, etc.)
3. Higher-order stiffness: $V^{(k+1)}(x^*) \neq 0$

**Statement:** While the linear stiffness is zero ($\lambda_1 = 0$), the nonlinear stiffness is positive and bounded. The system is "Stiff" in a higher-order sense, ensuring polynomial convergence $t^{-1/(k-1)}$ instead of exponential.

**Certificate Logic:**

$$K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{LS}_{\partial^k V}}^+ \Rightarrow K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^{\sim} \quad (\text{Polynomial Rate})$$

**Interface Permit Validated:** Gradient Domination (Higher Order).

**Literature:** {cite}`Thom75`; {cite}`Arnold72`; {cite}`PostonStewart78`
:::

:::{prf:proof}

The Łojasiewicz exponent at a degenerate critical point is $\theta = 1/k$ for the $A_{k-1}$ catastrophe (Thom, 1975). For the normal form $V(x) = x^{k+1}/(k+1)$ with critical point at $x^* = 0$, we have $\nabla V(x) = x^k$ and $V(x) - V(x^*) = x^{k+1}/(k+1)$. The Łojasiewicz gradient inequality $\|\nabla V(x)\| \geq C|V(x) - V(x^*)|^{1-\theta}$ with $\theta = 1/k$ becomes $|x^k| \geq C|x^{k+1}|^{(k-1)/k}$. Since $(k+1)(k-1)/k = k - 1/k < k$ for $k \geq 2$, this holds near $x=0$. Integrating the gradient flow $\dot{x} = -x^k$ yields polynomial convergence $|x(t)| \sim t^{-1/(k-1)}$. Arnold's classification (1972) ensures these are the only structurally stable degeneracies.

### Inconclusive Discharge Upgrades

:::{div} feynman-prose
There is an important distinction between "no" and "I do not know yet."

A blocked certificate says: "I checked, and this barrier is stopping the singularity." That is definite information. But an inconclusive certificate says something different: "I cannot decide because I am missing some prerequisite information."

Think of it like a conditional proof in logic. You want to prove $P$, but you need lemma $Q$ first. Until you have $Q$, you cannot say whether $P$ is true or false---you can only say "if $Q$ then $P$." The inconclusive certificate records exactly this: the obligation (what you want to prove), the missing premises (what you need first), and a trace of why you got stuck.

The upgrade rules handle two scenarios. First, the missing premises might become available later in the same Sieve pass---another node might produce exactly the certificate you need. Second, the premises might come from a completely different branch of the verification graph, filled in during closure.

Either way, the moment all missing premises are satisfied, the inconclusive certificate upgrades to a full YES. The obligation is discharged. This is the logical analogue of conditional proof: once you have all the hypotheses, you get the conclusion.
:::

The following metatheorems formalize inc-upgrade rules. Blocked certificates indicate "cannot proceed"; inconclusive certificates indicate "cannot decide with current prerequisites."

:::{prf:theorem} [UP-IncComplete] Inconclusive Discharge by Missing-Premise Completion
:label: mt-up-inc-complete

**Context:** A node returns $K_P^{\mathrm{inc}} = (\mathsf{obligation}, \mathsf{missing}, \mathsf{code}, \mathsf{trace})$ where $\mathsf{missing}$ specifies the certificate types that would enable decision.

**Hypotheses:** For each $m \in \mathsf{missing}$, the context $\Gamma$ contains a certificate $K_m^+$ such that:

$$\bigwedge_{m \in \mathsf{missing}} K_m^+ \Rightarrow \mathsf{obligation}$$

**Statement:** The inconclusive permit upgrades immediately to YES:

$$K_P^{\mathrm{inc}} \wedge \bigwedge_{m \in \mathsf{missing}} K_m^+ \Rightarrow K_P^+$$

**Certificate Logic:**

$$\mathsf{Obl}(\Gamma) \setminus \{(\mathsf{id}_P, \ldots)\} \cup \{K_P^+\}$$

**Interface Permit Validated:** Original predicate $P$ (via prerequisite completion).

**Literature:** Binary Certificate Logic (Definition {prf:ref}`def-typed-no-certificates`); Obligation Ledger (Definition {prf:ref}`def-obligation-ledger`).
:::

:::{prf:proof}

The NO-inconclusive certificate records an epistemic gap, not a semantic refutation (Definition {prf:ref}`def-typed-no-certificates`). When all prerequisites in $\mathsf{missing}$ are satisfied, the original predicate $P$ becomes decidable. The discharge condition (Definition {prf:ref}`def-inc-upgrades`) ensures the premises genuinely imply the obligation. The upgrade is sound because $K^{\mathrm{inc}}$ records the exact obligation and its missing prerequisites; when those prerequisites are satisfied, the original predicate $P$ holds by the discharge condition.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} [UP-IncAposteriori] A-Posteriori Inconclusive Discharge
:label: mt-up-inc-aposteriori

**Context:** $K_P^{\mathrm{inc}}$ is produced at node $i$, and later nodes add certificates that satisfy its $\mathsf{missing}$ set.

**Hypotheses:** Let $\Gamma_i$ be the context at node $i$ with $K_P^{\mathrm{inc}} \in \Gamma_i$. Later nodes produce $\{K_{j_1}^+, \ldots, K_{j_k}^+\}$ such that the certificate types satisfy:

$$\{\mathrm{type}(K_{j_1}^+), \ldots, \mathrm{type}(K_{j_k}^+)\} \supseteq \mathsf{missing}(K_P^{\mathrm{inc}})$$

**Statement:** During promotion closure (Definition {prf:ref}`def-closure`), the inconclusive certificate upgrades:

$$K_P^{\mathrm{inc}} \wedge \bigwedge_{m \in \mathsf{missing}(K_P^{\mathrm{inc}})} K_m^+ \Rightarrow K_P^+$$

**Certificate Logic:**

$$\mathrm{Cl}(\Gamma_{\mathrm{final}}) \ni K_P^+ \quad \text{(discharged from } K_P^{\mathrm{inc}} \text{)}$$

**Consequence:** The obligation ledger $\mathsf{Obl}(\mathrm{Cl}(\Gamma_{\mathrm{final}}))$ contains strictly fewer entries than $\mathsf{Obl}(\Gamma_{\mathrm{final}})$ if any inc-upgrades fired during closure.

**Interface Permit Validated:** Original predicate $P$ (retroactively).

**Literature:** Promotion Closure (Definition {prf:ref}`def-promotion-closure`); Kleene fixed-point iteration {cite}`Kleene52`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}

The promotion closure iterates until fixed point. On each iteration, inc-upgrade rules (Definition {prf:ref}`def-inc-upgrades`) are applied alongside blk-promotion rules. The a-posteriori discharge is triggered when certificates from later nodes enter the closure and match the $\mathsf{missing}$ set. Termination follows from the certificate finiteness condition (Definition {prf:ref}`def-cert-finite`).
