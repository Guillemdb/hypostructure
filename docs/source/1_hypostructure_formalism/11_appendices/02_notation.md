# Appendix B: Notation Index

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me tell you how to use this notation index, because notation is one of those things that can either help you think or get in your way.

The Hypostructure formalism uses a lot of symbols, and at first glance it might look like alphabet soup. But there is a logic to it. We have organized the notation by *role*: what job does this symbol do in the theory? Core objects come first, the fundamental building blocks like state spaces and energy functionals. Then energy and scaling, boundary operations, certificates, categorical machinery, and so on.

Here is my advice: do not try to memorize this table. Instead, use it as a reference when you encounter an unfamiliar symbol. The "Reference" column tells you exactly where that symbol is formally defined. Follow those links. See the symbol in context. That is how notation becomes meaningful rather than arbitrary.

One thing to watch for: some symbols do double duty. The letter $\mathcal{B}$ can mean boundary space or Boolean subalgebra or bridge certificate, depending on context. We have tried to use subscripts and formatting to disambiguate, but pay attention to the surrounding text when you see these overloaded symbols.
:::

The following notation is used consistently throughout this document. Symbols are organized by their role in the Hypostructure formalism.

(sec-notation-core-objects)=
## Core Objects

:::{div} feynman-prose
These are the fundamental ingredients of any hypostructure. Think of them as the atoms from which everything else is built.

The state space $\mathcal{X}$ is where your system lives. The boundary space $\mathcal{B}$ is how your system talks to the outside world. The height functional $\Phi$ measures how "bad" a state is (higher means worse). Dissipation $\mathfrak{D}$ measures how much energy is being lost. The symmetry group $G$ captures what transformations leave the physics unchanged.

And the hypostructure $\mathbb{H}$ itself? That is the whole package: all five pieces bundled together into a single mathematical object that the Sieve can analyze.
:::

| Symbol | Name | Definition | Reference |
|--------|------|------------|-----------|
| $\mathcal{X}$ | State Space | Configuration $\infty$-stack representing system states | {prf:ref}`def-categorical-hypostructure` |
| $\mathcal{B}$ | Boundary Space | Environmental interface / boundary data | {ref}`Boundary Constraints <sec-boundary-constraints>` |
| $\Phi$ | Height / Energy | Cohomological height functional | {prf:ref}`def-categorical-hypostructure` |

| $\mathcal{T}$ | Thin Object | Minimal 5-tuple of physical data | {ref}`Thin Kernel <sec-thin-kernel>` |

(sec-notation-energy-scaling)=
## Energy and Scaling

:::{div} feynman-prose
Here is where we track how energy behaves as you zoom in and out. The exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tell you how energy and dissipation scale when you rescale the system. This is crucial for understanding singularities: if energy can concentrate at small scales without bound, you have a potential blowup.

The scaling operator $\mathcal{S}_\lambda$ is like a magnifying glass. Apply it with $\lambda < 1$ and you are zooming in; apply it with $\lambda > 1$ and you are zooming out. How physical quantities transform under this zooming is the heart of scaling theory.
:::

| Symbol | Name | Context |
|--------|------|---------|
| $E$ | Specific Energy | Instance of height $\Phi$; $E[\Phi] = \sup_t \Phi(u(t))$ |
| $\alpha$ | Energy Scaling | Exponent: $\Phi(\mathcal{S}_\lambda x) = \lambda^\alpha \Phi(x)$ |
| $\beta$ | Dissipation Scaling | Exponent: $\mathfrak{D}(\mathcal{S}_\lambda x) = \lambda^\beta \mathfrak{D}(x)$ |
| $E_{\text{sat}}$ | Saturation Ceiling | Upper bound on drift (BarrierSat) |
| $\mathcal{S}_\lambda$ | Scaling Operator | One-parameter family of dilations |

(sec-notation-boundary-reinjection)=
## Boundary and Reinjection

:::{div} feynman-prose
When a system hits its boundary, something has to happen. These symbols describe the machinery for handling that transition.

The trace morphism $\operatorname{Tr}$ extracts the boundary data from a state: "What does this state look like at the edge?" The flux morphism $\mathcal{J}$ measures energy flow across the boundary: "How much is going in or out?" And the reinjection kernel $\mathcal{R}$ is the stochastic rule for putting the system back into play after it exits: "Given boundary data, what distribution of interior states do we restart from?"

This is the mathematical machinery for handling what physicists call "boundary conditions" and what computer scientists might call "exception handling."
:::

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| $\partial_\bullet$ | Boundary Morphism | Restriction functor $\iota^*: \mathbf{Sh}_\infty(\mathcal{X}) \to \mathbf{Sh}_\infty(\partial\mathcal{X})$ |
| $\operatorname{Tr}$ | Trace Morphism | $\operatorname{Tr}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{B}$ (restriction to boundary) |
| $\mathcal{J}$ | Flux Morphism | $\mathcal{J}: \mathcal{B} \to \underline{\mathbb{R}}$ (energy flow across boundary) |
| $\mathcal{R}$ | Reinjection Kernel | $\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$ (Markov kernel with Feller property) |

(sec-notation-certificates)=
## Certificate Notation

:::{div} feynman-prose
Certificates are the Sieve's way of keeping receipts. When a node makes a judgment, it does not just say "yes" or "no" and move on. It produces a *certificate* explaining its answer.

The basic dichotomy is $K^+$ (yes, the property holds) versus $K^-$ (no, it does not). But the "no" case has structure: did we find an actual counterexample ($K^{\mathrm{wit}}$, a witness to failure), or did our method simply fail to verify ($K^{\mathrm{inc}}$, inconclusive)? This distinction matters enormously. A counterexample is definitive; inconclusiveness might just mean we need a better method.

For barrier nodes, we have blocked ($K^{\text{blk}}$) versus breached ($K^{\text{br}}$), and for reinjection, success ($K^{\text{re}}$). The full chain $\Gamma$ accumulates all these certificates as the Sieve runs.
:::

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $K^+$ | Positive certificate (predicate holds) |
| $K^-$ | Negative certificate (sum type: $K^{\mathrm{wit}} \sqcup K^{\mathrm{inc}}$) |
| $K^{\mathrm{wit}}$ | NO-with-witness certificate (actual refutation / counterexample found) |
| $K^{\mathrm{inc}}$ | NO-inconclusive certificate (method insufficient, not a semantic refutation) |
| $K^{\circ}$ | Neutral/benign certificate (classification without failure) |
| $K^{\text{blk}}$ | Blocked certificate (barrier holds, obstruction present) |
| $K^{\text{br}}$ | Breached certificate (barrier fails: $K^{\mathrm{br\text{-}wit}}$ or $K^{\mathrm{br\text{-}inc}}$) |
| $K^{\text{re}}$ | Re-entry certificate (surgery completed successfully) |
| $K^{\mathrm{ext}}$ | Extension certificate (synthetic/auxiliary extension required) |
| $K^{\mathrm{morph}}$ | Morphism-found certificate (explicit bad-pattern embedding) |
| $K^{\mathrm{hor}}$ | Horizon certificate (epistemic/paradox horizon reached) |
| $\Gamma$ | Certificate accumulator (full chain of certificates) |

**Derived witness certificates (auxiliary bounds):**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $K_{D_{\max}}^+$ | Bounded algorithmic diameter witness (payload: $D_{\max}$) |
| $K_{\rho_{\max}}^+$ | Uniform invariant/QSD density bound witness (payload: $\rho_{\max}$) |

(sec-notation-categorical)=
## Categorical Notation

:::{div} feynman-prose
Now we enter the realm of category theory. Do not be intimidated. Categories are just a language for talking about mathematical structures and the relationships between them.

The ambient topos $\mathcal{E}$ is the mathematical universe where everything lives. Think of it as "the space of all spaces." The categories $\mathbf{Hypo}_T$ and $\mathbf{Thin}_T$ are subcollections: all hypostructures of a given type $T$, and all thin kernels of that type.

The "bad pattern" $\mathbb{H}_{\text{bad}}$ is central to the whole theory. It represents what you do not want: a singularity, a blowup, a failure. The Sieve's job is to prove that your hypostructure has no morphism from the bad pattern to itself. That is what $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathbb{H}_{\text{bad}}, \mathbb{H}) = \emptyset$ means: no way for badness to embed into your system.
:::

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| $\mathcal{E}$ | Ambient Topos | Cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos |
| $\mathbf{Hypo}_T$ | Hypostructure Category | Category of type-$T$ hypostructures |
| $\mathbf{Thin}_T$ | Thin Category | Category of thin kernel objects |
| $\mathbb{H}_{\text{bad}}$ | Bad Pattern | Universal singularity object |
| $\operatorname{Hom}(\cdot, \cdot)$ | Hom Functor | Morphism space (Node 17 Lock) |
| $F_{\text{Sieve}}$ | Sieve Functor | Left adjoint $F_{\text{Sieve}} \dashv U$ |

(sec-notation-interface-identifiers)=
## Interface Identifiers

:::{div} feynman-prose
Each Sieve node has an interface, a contract specifying what it checks and what it promises. These identifiers name those interfaces.

The subscripts often hint at the physical quantity involved: $D_E$ for energy, $C_\mu$ for compactness with respect to a measure $\mu$, $\mathrm{SC}_\lambda$ for scaling by parameter $\lambda$. When you see these in the text, they are referring to specific diagnostic checkpoints in the Sieve pipeline.
:::

| $D_E$ | Energy Interface | Node 1 |
| $\mathrm{Rec}_N$ | Recovery Interface | Node 2 |
| $C_\mu$ | Compactness Interface | Node 3 |

| $\mathrm{Cap}_H$ | Capacity Interface | Node 6 |
| $\mathrm{LS}_\sigma$ | Stiffness Interface | Node 7 |

| $\mathrm{Rep}_K$ | Complexity Interface | Node 11 |
| $\mathrm{GC}_\nabla$ | Gradient Interface | Node 12 |
| $\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}$ | Categorical Interface | Node 17 |

(sec-notation-rigor-classification)=
## Rigor Classification

:::{div} feynman-prose
Not all proofs are created equal. We classify them by where the rigor comes from.

**Class L (Literature-Anchored):** We are standing on the shoulders of giants. The proof works because we can cite a theorem from the established literature. Our job is to verify that the hypotheses of that theorem are satisfied in our context.

**Class F (Framework-Original):** We are doing the work ourselves, inside the categorical framework. These proofs use the cohesive topos machinery directly.

**Class B (Bridge):** We are translating between worlds. The categorical proof yields a conclusion, and we need to verify that this conclusion has a sensible meaning in classical foundations (ZFC set theory). Bridge verification is about making sure nothing is lost in translation.
:::

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| Rigor Class L | Literature-Anchored | Proof rigor offloaded to external literature via Bridge Verification (Def. {prf:ref}`def-rigor-classification`) |
| Rigor Class F | Framework-Original | First-principles categorical proof using cohesive topos theory (Def. {prf:ref}`def-rigor-classification`) |
| Rigor Class B | Bridge | Cross-foundation translation between categorical framework and classical foundations (Def. {prf:ref}`def-rigor-classification`) |
| $\mathcal{H}_{\text{tr}}$ | Hypothesis Translation | Bridge Verification Step 1: $\Gamma_{\text{Sieve}} \vdash \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{L}}$ |

| $\mathcal{C}_{\text{imp}}$ | Conclusion Import | Bridge Verification Step 3: $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{L}}(\iota(\mathbb{H})) \Rightarrow K^+$ |
| $\Pi \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp$ | Cohesion Adjunction | Shape/Flat/Sharp modality adjunction in cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos |
| $\mathcal{F} \dashv U$ | Expansion Adjunction | Thin-to-Hypo expansion as left adjoint (Thm. {prf:ref}`thm-expansion-adjunction`) |

(sec-notation-progress-measures)=
## Progress Measures (Type A/B)

:::{div} feynman-prose
How do you know a procedure terminates? You need a progress measure, something that gets better at each step and cannot get better forever.

**Type A** is like a budget: you start with a fixed amount, each operation costs something, and you cannot spend more than you have. Eventually you run out of budget and must stop.

**Type B** is like a well-founded order: each step takes you to something "smaller" in a sense that has no infinite descending chains. You cannot keep going down forever, so eventually you reach bottom.

Both types guarantee termination, but they suit different situations. Type A is good when you have explicit resource bounds; Type B is good when you have structural decrease but no obvious counting argument.
:::

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| Type A | Bounded Count | Surgery count bounded by $N(T, \Phi(x_0))$; finite budget termination |
| Type B | Well-Founded | Complexity measure $\mathcal{C}: X \to \mathbb{N}$ strictly decreases per surgery |

**Note:** Type A/B classification refers to *progress measures* for termination analysis (Definition {prf:ref}`def-progress-measures`), distinct from Rigor Class L/F/B which refers to *proof provenance*.

(sec-notation-zfc-translation)=
## ZFC Translation

:::{div} feynman-prose
Here we connect the categorical machinery to classical set theory. Why bother? Because many mathematicians work in ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice), and they want to know: "Can I trust these categorical proofs? Can I understand the conclusions without learning topos theory?"

The answer is yes, via translation. The key tool is the truncation functor $\tau_0$, which extracts the "set-theoretic shadow" of a higher categorical object. You lose some information (the higher homotopy), but you preserve what matters for most applications.

The Grothendieck universe $\mathcal{U}$ handles size issues. The bridge certificate $\mathcal{B}_{\text{ZFC}}$ records exactly which ZFC axioms were used and whether the Axiom of Choice was needed. Transparency is the goal.

(sec-notation-key-bridge-theorems)=
## Key Bridge Theorems

:::{div} feynman-prose
These are the headlines, the theorems that make the whole translation machinery worth building.

The Fundamental Theorem says: if the categorical machinery proves that no bad pattern can embed into your hypostructure, then in plain set-theoretic language, no singular point exists. That is the payoff. All the topos theory, all the higher categories, all the modalities, they funnel down to a statement you can verify in classical foundations.

The Singular Point Contradiction corollary makes this even sharper: the existence of a singular point would lead to a contradiction in ZFC. No fancy category theory needed to check the final answer.

## ZFC Axiom Abbreviations

:::{div} feynman-prose
Every ZFC axiom has a job to do in the translation. This table tracks which axioms are used by which Sieve nodes.

Why care? Because if you are working in a weaker foundation (say, ZF without Choice), you want to know which parts of the machinery still apply. The axiom audit trail lets you see exactly where Choice enters and which conclusions remain valid without it.

(sec-notation-ait)=
## Algorithmic Information Theory

:::{div} feynman-prose
Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) provides a rigorous way to talk about complexity and randomness. The central quantity is Kolmogorov complexity $K(x)$: the length of the shortest program that outputs $x$. Simple strings have small $K$; random strings have $K$ close to their length.

Chaitin's $\Omega$ is one of the most remarkable numbers in mathematics: it encodes the probability that a random program halts. This number is well-defined, but uncomputable. It lies at the boundary between what algorithms can and cannot do.

Computational depth $d_s(x)$ measures how much computation is "locked up" in a string: a string can be simple (low $K$) but deep (requiring long computation). Levin complexity $Kt$ combines program length and runtime, bridging information and thermodynamics.

(sec-notation-ait-phase-classification)=
## AIT Phase Classification

:::{div} feynman-prose
Matter has phases: solid, liquid, gas. It turns out that computational problems have phases too, distinguished by their algorithmic complexity.

**Crystal:** The simple phase. Problems here have logarithmic complexity, meaning they can be described much more compactly than their size suggests. They are decidable and yield REGULAR verdicts from the Sieve.

**Liquid:** The intermediate phase. Still logarithmically complex, but something has gone wrong with "Axiom R" (a technical condition about recursive structure). These problems are computationally enumerable but not decidable. The Sieve returns HORIZON, meaning we are at the edge of what computation can handle.

**Gas:** The random phase. Maximum complexity, no structure to exploit. These strings are algorithmically random, undecidable, and also yield HORIZON verdicts.

The beautiful thing is that these phase transitions mirror thermodynamic phase transitions. The mathematics is the same because the underlying structure, how information organizes itself, is the same.
:::

| Phase | Complexity | Axiom R | Decidability | Sieve Verdict |
|-------|------------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Crystal | $K = O(\log n)$ | Holds | Decidable | REGULAR |
| Liquid | No $K(L_n)$ bound implied; c.e. but R fails | Fails | C.E. not decidable | HORIZON |
| Gas | $K \geq n - O(1)$ | Fails | Random/Undecidable | HORIZON |

See {prf:ref}`def-algorithmic-phases` for formal definitions and {prf:ref}`thm-sieve-thermo-correspondence` for the Sieve-Thermodynamic Correspondence.

:::{prf:remark}
:label: rem-hypo-notation-liquid-phase
Liquid phase classification uses enumerability plus Axiom R failure; it does not imply $K(L_n) = O(\log n)$ for initial segments (here $L_n$ is the length-$n$ prefix of the characteristic sequence of $L$).
