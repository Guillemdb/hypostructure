## Foundation - Sieve Cross-Reference

:::{div} feynman-prose
Now let me tell you what this chapter is really about. We have built an elaborate safety system---the Sieve---with its sixty diagnostic nodes, its barriers, its surgeries. But you might reasonably ask: "Where does all this machinery come from? Is it just clever engineering, or is there something deeper going on?"

The answer is that every single piece of the Sieve has a mathematical pedigree. Each node, each barrier, each surgery operation is not just a good idea someone had---it is a theorem in disguise. The tables that follow are the Rosetta Stone of our framework: they map each operational component to the foundational mathematics that justifies it.

Why does this matter? Because when you see a ScaleCheck node flagging a violation, you are not just seeing a heuristic alarm. You are seeing the Merle-Zaag blow-up theory, the Kenig-Merle concentration-compactness machinery, all those decades of PDE analysis, packaged into a single predicate: is $\beta - \alpha < \lambda_c$ (with $\lambda_c = 0$ in the homogeneous case)?

Think of it this way: the Sieve is the user interface; these theorems are the source code.

The following table provides the complete mapping from Sieve components to their substantiating foundational theorems.

### Kernel Logic Cross-Reference

:::{div} feynman-prose
The kernel logic is where the Sieve makes its fundamental decisions. These are not arbitrary design choices---they emerge from deep categorical and functional-analytic structures. When we lock out a pathological trajectory, we are applying Grothendieck's exclusion principles. When we classify singularities into trichotomous types, we draw on Lions' concentration-compactness. The kernel is category theory wearing work clothes.

### Gate Evaluator Cross-Reference

:::{div} feynman-prose
Here is where the rubber meets the road. The blue nodes are the gates---the yes/no decision points that determine whether a trajectory proceeds safely or gets flagged. Each gate implements a mathematical predicate, and each predicate distills a theorem into a single inequality.

Look at the ScaleCheck gate: "$\beta - \alpha < \lambda_c$"---that is all it asks. But behind that simple question stands the entire edifice of blow-up analysis. If the exponents satisfy $\beta - \alpha < \lambda_c$ (with $\lambda_c = 0$ in the homogeneous case), supercritical self-similar blow-up is excluded. You do not need to understand Merle and Zaag's intricate estimates; the Sieve has done that work for you and reduced it to a single comparison.

This is the beauty of the design: profound mathematics becomes operational through abstraction.

(sec-barrier-defense-cross-reference)=
### Barrier Defense Cross-Reference

:::{div} feynman-prose
The orange barriers are where the Sieve says "no further"---these are the walls that prevent pathological outcomes. Each barrier implements a blocking mechanism derived from a conservation law or an impossibility theorem.

Consider the Bode barrier. It encodes the waterbed effect from control theory: you cannot suppress sensitivity everywhere. If you push it down at one frequency, it pops up somewhere else. The integral $\int \log|S| d\omega$ is conserved. This is not negotiable; it is a theorem.

Or take the epistemic barrier, which enforces the data processing inequality. Information cannot be created by processing---$I(X;Z) \leq I(X;Y)$ for any Markov chain $X \to Y \to Z$. The barrier turns this fundamental limit into operational enforcement.

These are not soft constraints. They are mathematical walls.

(sec-surgery-construction-cross-reference)=
### Surgery Construction Cross-Reference

:::{div} feynman-prose
When the gates flag a problem and the barriers cannot contain it, the Sieve does not simply give up. It performs surgery. The purple nodes are constructive---they actively modify the problem to restore tractability.

Each surgery operation is a mathematical construction technique lifted from a different field. Hairer's regularity structures let us make sense of ill-posed SPDEs. Perelman's Ricci flow surgery cuts out singularities and caps off the wounds. The BRST construction introduces ghost fields to cancel infinite gauge volumes.

Notice the pattern: every surgery solves a specific obstruction by extending the mathematical framework. We do not fight the mathematics; we enlarge the arena until the problem becomes tractable.

The column "Construction" tells you exactly what gets built: a regularity structure $\mathscr{T}$, a surgery procedure, slack variables, ghost fields, Lagrange multipliers, a conformal factor. These are the tools of the mathematical surgeon.
