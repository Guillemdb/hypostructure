## The Taxonomy of Computational Methods

This part establishes that polynomial-time algorithms must exploit specific structural invariants detectable by the Cohesive Topos modalities. It provides the theoretical foundation for **Tactic E13** (Algorithmic Completeness Lock), which closes the "Alien Algorithm" loophole in complexity-theoretic proofs.

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me tell you what this is really about. Whenever you see a fast algorithm, you should ask yourself: "Why is this fast? What structure is it exploiting?" Because here is the thing: if you have no structure, you are reduced to brute force, to trying things one by one until you stumble on the answer. And brute force takes exponential time.

Now, the question that has haunted complexity theory is this: could there be some clever algorithm we have not thought of yet? Some "alien" technique that solves hard problems fast without exploiting any recognizable structure? This chapter says no. We claim that every efficient algorithm must be built from one or more of five fundamental types of structure, which we call the five "modalities." If your problem has none of these structures, no algorithm can help you.

This is a bold claim. How can we be sure we have not missed a sixth modality? The answer lies in category theory: in a cohesive topos, these five modalities exhaust the ways that structure can manifest. They are not arbitrary categories we invented; they arise from the fundamental adjunctions that define what "structure" means in the first place.

### Cohesive Topos Foundations for Computation

Before classifying algorithms, we must establish the precise mathematical structure that makes algorithmic analysis possible. The key insight is that polynomial-time algorithms exploit **structure**, and in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos, all structure decomposes into modal components.

:::{prf:definition} Cohesive $(\infty,1)$-Topos Structure
:label: def-cohesive-topos-computation

A **cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos** is an $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ equipped with an adjoint quadruple of functors to the base topos $\infty\text{-Grpd}$:

$$\Pi \dashv \mathrm{Disc} \dashv \Gamma \dashv \mathrm{coDisc} : \mathbf{H} \to \infty\text{-Grpd}$$

where:
- $\Pi: \mathbf{H} \to \infty\text{-Grpd}$ — **shape** (fundamental $\infty$-groupoid, extracts causal/topological structure)
- $\mathrm{Disc}: \infty\text{-Grpd} \to \mathbf{H}$ — **discrete** (embeds discrete types, left adjoint to $\Gamma$)
- $\Gamma: \mathbf{H} \to \infty\text{-Grpd}$ — **global sections** (underlying $\infty$-groupoid of points)
- $\mathrm{coDisc}: \infty\text{-Grpd} \to \mathbf{H}$ — **codiscrete** (embeds codiscrete types, right adjoint to $\Gamma$)

satisfying the **cohesion axioms**:
1. $\mathrm{Disc}$ and $\mathrm{coDisc}$ are fully faithful
2. $\Pi$ preserves finite products
3. **(Pieces have points)** The canonical natural transformation $\Gamma \to \Pi$ (the points-to-pieces comparison) is an epimorphism of functors $\mathbf{H} \to \infty\text{-Grpd}$, i.e., for every $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbf{H}$ the induced map $\Gamma(\mathcal{X}) \to \Pi(\mathcal{X})$ is an effective epimorphism of $\infty$-groupoids

:::{prf:definition} The Five Computational Modalities
:label: def-five-modalities

From the adjoint quadruple, we derive the **cohesive modalities** as (co)monads. These are the **complete set** of structural resources available in a cohesive topos:

**Basic Modalities (from adjunctions):**

| Modality | Definition | Type | Intuition |
|----------|------------|------|-----------|
| $\int$ (shape) | $\mathrm{Disc} \circ \Pi$ | Monad | Discretize the shape (causal structure) |
| $\flat$ (flat) | $\mathrm{Disc} \circ \Gamma$ | Comonad | Discrete points (algebraic structure) |
| $\sharp$ (sharp) | $\mathrm{coDisc} \circ \Gamma$ | Monad | Codiscrete points (metric structure) |

These satisfy the **modal adjunction triple**:

$$\int \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp$$

with reduction properties:
- $\flat \int \simeq \int$ and $\int \flat \simeq \flat$ (reduction identities from fully faithful embeddings)
- $\sharp \int \simeq \int$ and $\int \sharp \simeq \flat$ (reduction identities under strong cohesion)

**Extended Modalities (for computational completeness):**

**Scaling Modality** $\ast$:

$$\ast := \mathrm{colim}_{n \to \infty} \int^{(n)}$$

where $\int^{(n)}$ is the $n$-fold iteration of shape. This captures self-similar/recursive structure via iterated coarse-graining.

**Boundary/Holographic Modality** $\partial$:

$$\partial := \mathrm{fib}(\eta_\sharp : \mathrm{id} \to \sharp)$$

the homotopy fiber of the sharp unit. This captures boundary/interface structure—the difference between a type and its codiscretification.

**Computational Completeness:** The five modalities $\{\int, \flat, \sharp, \ast, \partial\}$ exhaust all structural resources that polynomial-time algorithms can exploit. This is not an empirical observation but a **theorem** of cohesive topos theory ({prf:ref}`thm-schreiber-structure`).
:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me explain what these modalities really mean. Think of a space $\mathcal{X}$ as having multiple "views" or "shadows" that reveal different aspects of its structure:

The **shape** $\int \mathcal{X}$ forgets everything except connectivity—which points can reach which. It is like looking at a road network and ignoring distances, just tracking which cities connect.

The **flat** $\flat \mathcal{X}$ keeps only the discrete, algebraic structure—like the lattice points in a continuous space, or the group elements in a space with symmetry.

The **sharp** $\sharp \mathcal{X}$ makes everything "as connected as possible"—it is the view where you can continuously deform any path to any other. This reveals the metric, continuous structure.

The **scaling** $\ast$ captures what happens when you zoom out infinitely—the self-similar patterns that persist at all scales.

The **boundary** $\partial$ captures what you can see from the outside—the holographic projection that encodes bulk information.

The deep theorem we are using says: these five views are **complete**. Every structural pattern in $\mathcal{X}$ appears in at least one of these modal shadows. If your algorithm exploits structure, it must show up in one of these five places.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Schreiber Structure Theorem (Computational Form)
:label: thm-schreiber-structure

Let $\mathbf{H}$ be a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos. Every type $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbf{H}$ decomposes via **fracture squares** into its modal components. Specifically:

1. **Shape--flat fracture square.** The canonical diagram

$$\mathcal{X} \simeq \int\mathcal{X} \times_{\int\flat\mathcal{X}} \flat\mathcal{X}$$
is a homotopy pullback.

2. **Flat--sharp fracture square.** The canonical diagram

$$\flat\mathcal{X} \simeq \flat\mathcal{X} \times_{\flat\sharp\mathcal{X}} \sharp\mathcal{X}$$
is a homotopy pullback (in the sense that the flat component itself decomposes into its discrete and codiscrete parts).

Moreover, any morphism $f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ factors (up to homotopy) through the induced pullback decomposition: $f$ is determined by its modal projections $\int f$, $\flat f$, $\sharp f$ together with the compatibility data in the fracture squares.

**Consequence for Algorithms:** The five modalities supply the exhaustive list of pure structural routes that can appear
in the algorithmic witness language introduced below. By itself, this theorem identifies the modal leaves; the full
claim that internally polynomial-time families are exactly the saturated closure of those leaves is deferred to
{prf:ref}`cor-computational-modal-exhaustiveness`.

**Literature:** {cite}`SchreiberCohesive` Section 3; {cite}`Schreiber13`
:::

:::{prf:proof}
We work in a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$ with adjoint quadruple
$\Pi \dashv \mathrm{Disc} \dashv \Gamma \dashv \mathrm{coDisc}$.
The three idempotent (co)monads $\int := \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi$,
$\flat := \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma$, $\sharp := \mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma$
are the *only* idempotent modal operators generated by the adjoint quadruple
({cite}`SchreiberCohesive`, Section 3.8; {cite}`Lawvere69`).

The fracture squares of Schreiber ({cite}`SchreiberCohesive`, Proposition 3.8.8;
note that numbering may vary between manuscript versions — some editions label this
as Theorem 3.8.5) provide the operative decomposition. The shape--flat fracture
square gives the homotopy pullback
$\mathcal{X} \simeq \int\mathcal{X} \times_{\int\flat\mathcal{X}} \flat\mathcal{X}$,
and the flat--sharp fracture square gives
$\flat\mathcal{X} \simeq \flat\mathcal{X} \times_{\flat\sharp\mathcal{X}} \sharp\mathcal{X}$.
These are pullback decompositions, not coend decompositions. Applying the
fracture squares to an arbitrary morphism $f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$, the
universal property of pullbacks shows that $f$ is determined by its modal
projections $\int f$, $\flat f$, $\sharp f$ together with the compatibility
data enforced by the fracture squares.

The extended modalities $\ast := \mathrm{colim}_{k}\int^{(k)}$ and
$\partial := \mathrm{fib}(\eta_\sharp : \mathrm{id}\to\sharp)$ arise as
derived operations: $\ast$ is the transfinite iterate (stabilizing at the
shape fixed-point reflection), and $\partial$ is the homotopy fiber of the
sharp unit. These are the only structurally new operations beyond $\int,\flat,\sharp$
(any other composite of the four adjoint functors reduces to one of the five
by the reduction identities $\flat\int\simeq\int$, $\int\flat\simeq\flat$ (from fully faithful embeddings)
and $\sharp\int\simeq\int$, $\int\sharp\simeq\flat$ (under strong cohesion;
see {prf:ref}`rem-strong-cohesion-requirement`)). Hence the fracture-square
decomposition ranges over exactly the five modalities of {prf:ref}`def-five-modalities`.
:::

:::{prf:corollary} Exhaustive Modal Decomposition
:label: cor-exhaustive-decomposition

Every type $\mathcal{X}$ in a cohesive topos admits a canonical decomposition:

$$\mathcal{X} \simeq \mathcal{X}_{\int} \times_{\mathcal{X}_0} \mathcal{X}_{\flat} \times_{\mathcal{X}_0} \mathcal{X}_{\sharp}$$

where:
- $\mathcal{X}_{\int}$ is the shape component (causal/topological structure)
- $\mathcal{X}_{\flat}$ is the flat component (discrete/algebraic structure)
- $\mathcal{X}_{\sharp}$ is the sharp component (continuous/metric structure)
- $\mathcal{X}_0 := \flat\mathcal{X}$ is the base (the underlying discrete structure, i.e., pure points with no topology or metric)

Any morphism decomposes accordingly. The extended modalities $\ast$ and $\partial$ capture derived patterns (scaling and holography) built from these basic components.

**Key Insight:** This decomposition is **not a choice**—it is a theorem. The modalities exhaust the available structure because they **are** the structure of the topos. There is no "sixth modality" any more than there is a sixth direction orthogonal to all dimensions of space.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Apply the fracture-square decomposition of {prf:ref}`thm-schreiber-structure` to the identity
morphism $\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{X}} : \mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{X}$. The shape--flat
fracture square ({cite}`SchreiberCohesive`, Proposition 3.8.8) gives the pullback
$\mathcal{X} \simeq \int\mathcal{X} \times_{\int\flat\mathcal{X}} \flat\mathcal{X}$,
and the flat--sharp fracture square gives
$\flat\mathcal{X} \simeq \flat\mathcal{X} \times_{\flat\sharp\mathcal{X}} \sharp\mathcal{X}$.
Composing these two pullback decompositions and noting that the base objects
coincide—the shape–flat square has base $\int\flat\mathcal{X} \simeq \flat\mathcal{X}$
(by the reduction identity $\int\!\flat\simeq\flat$), and the flat–sharp square has base
$\flat\sharp\mathcal{X} \simeq \flat\mathcal{X}$ (since
$\flat\!\sharp = \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma\circ\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma = \flat$)—we set
$\mathcal{X}_0 := \flat\mathcal{X}$ and obtain the fiber product
$\mathcal{X} \simeq \mathcal{X}_{\int} \times_{\mathcal{X}_0} \mathcal{X}_{\flat} \times_{\mathcal{X}_0} \mathcal{X}_{\sharp}$.
The extended modalities $\ast$ and $\partial$ capture the remaining derived
structure (scaling and boundary) as established in {prf:ref}`thm-schreiber-structure`.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Five-Modality Completeness Argument
:label: rem-five-modality-completeness-argument

We prove that the five modalities $(\int, \flat, \sharp, \ast, \partial)$ exhaust all
structurally distinct polynomial-time-exploitable modalities generated by the adjoint
quadruple $\Pi \dashv \mathrm{Disc} \dashv \Gamma \dashv \mathrm{coDisc}$, by
exhaustive case analysis on all compositions of the four functors.

**Preliminary identities.** Since $\mathrm{Disc}$ is fully faithful (left adjoint
$\Pi$ and right adjoint $\Gamma$ both retract it), we have the counit/unit
isomorphisms:

$$
\Pi \circ \mathrm{Disc} \simeq \mathrm{id}_{\mathbf{Set}}, \qquad
\Gamma \circ \mathrm{Disc} \simeq \mathrm{id}_{\mathbf{Set}}.
$$

Similarly, $\mathrm{coDisc}$ is fully faithful (its left adjoint $\Gamma$ retracts
it):

$$
\Gamma \circ \mathrm{coDisc} \simeq \mathrm{id}_{\mathbf{Set}}.
$$

These are standard consequences of the adjunction (see {cite}`SchreiberCohesive`,
Proposition 3.8.1 and {cite}`Lawvere69`). We also record the four **reduction
identities** among the basic modalities:

$$
\flat\!\int \simeq \int, \qquad
\sharp\!\int \simeq \int, \qquad
\int\!\flat \simeq \flat, \qquad
\int\!\sharp \simeq \flat.
$$(eq-reduction-identities)

These follow from the fully-faithfulness identities: for instance,
$\flat\!\int = (\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma)\circ(\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi)
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ(\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc})\circ\Pi
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ\mathrm{id}\circ\Pi = \int$
(using $\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc}\simeq\mathrm{id}$).
Similarly, $\int\!\flat = (\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi)\circ(\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma)
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ(\Pi\circ\mathrm{Disc})\circ\Gamma
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma = \flat$
(using $\Pi\circ\mathrm{Disc}\simeq\mathrm{id}$).
For $\sharp\!\int\simeq\int$ (under strong cohesion,
{prf:ref}`rem-strong-cohesion-requirement`): expanding,
$\sharp\!\int = (\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma)\circ(\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi)
\simeq \mathrm{coDisc}\circ(\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc})\circ\Pi
\simeq \mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Pi$. Under the strong cohesion condition
$\mathrm{Disc}(S)\simeq\mathrm{coDisc}(S)$ for discrete $S$, we have
$\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Pi \simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi = \int$.
Hence $\sharp\!\int\simeq\int$.
For $\int\!\sharp\simeq\flat$ (under strong cohesion,
{prf:ref}`rem-strong-cohesion-requirement`): expanding,
$\int\!\sharp = (\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi)\circ(\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma)$.
Under the strong cohesion condition
$\mathrm{coDisc}(S)\simeq\mathrm{Disc}(S)$ for discrete $S$,
we have $\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma \simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma$,
so $\int\!\sharp \simeq (\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi)\circ(\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma)
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ(\Pi\circ\mathrm{Disc})\circ\Gamma
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma = \flat$
(using $\Pi\circ\mathrm{Disc}\simeq\mathrm{id}$).
Hence $\int\!\sharp\simeq\flat$.

**Case 1: Length-1 compositions.** The four individual functors $\Pi$, $\mathrm{Disc}$,
$\Gamma$, $\mathrm{coDisc}$ are not endofunctors on $\mathcal{H}$ alone ($\Pi$ and
$\Gamma$ map $\mathcal{H}\to\mathbf{Set}$; $\mathrm{Disc}$ and $\mathrm{coDisc}$ map
$\mathbf{Set}\to\mathcal{H}$), so they do not yield modalities on $\mathcal{H}$.

**Case 2: Length-2 compositions (endofunctors on $\mathcal{H}$).** To obtain an
endofunctor $\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$, we must compose a functor
$\mathbf{Set}\to\mathcal{H}$ with one $\mathcal{H}\to\mathbf{Set}$. The eight
ordered pairs and their reductions are:

| Composition | Type | Result | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| $\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi$ | $\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$ | $\int$ | Shape monad (definition) |
| $\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma$ | $\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$ | $\flat$ | Flat comonad (definition) |
| $\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma$ | $\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$ | $\sharp$ | Sharp monad (definition) |
| $\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Pi$ | $\mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}$ | $\int$ | $= \mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Pi$ (insert $\mathrm{id}\simeq\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc}$); reduces to $\sharp\!\int\simeq\int$ by {eq}`eq-reduction-identities` under strong cohesion ({prf:ref}`rem-strong-cohesion-requirement`) |
| $\Pi\circ\mathrm{Disc}$ | $\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}$ | $\mathrm{id}$ | Fully faithful retraction |
| $\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc}$ | $\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}$ | $\mathrm{id}$ | Fully faithful retraction |
| $\Gamma\circ\mathrm{coDisc}$ | $\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}$ | $\mathrm{id}$ | Fully faithful retraction |
| $\Pi\circ\mathrm{coDisc}$ | $\mathbf{Set}\to\mathbf{Set}$ | — | Endofunctor on $\mathbf{Set}$, not on $\mathcal{H}$; does not yield a modality |

The four $\mathcal{H}$-endofunctors reduce to exactly $\{\int, \flat, \sharp\}$. No
new modality appears at length 2.

**Case 3: Length-3+ compositions.** Any length-$n$ composition ($n\ge 3$) of functors
from $\{\Pi,\mathrm{Disc},\Gamma,\mathrm{coDisc}\}$ that is type-compatible and yields
an endofunctor on $\mathcal{H}$ must alternate between $\mathcal{H}\to\mathbf{Set}$ and
$\mathbf{Set}\to\mathcal{H}$ factors. It therefore decomposes as $M_1\circ M_2\circ
\cdots\circ M_k$ where each $M_i\in\{\int,\flat,\sharp\}$ (or identity, which we
absorb). The six pairwise compositions among $\{\int,\flat,\sharp\}$ all collapse:

$$
\flat\!\int \simeq \int, \qquad
\sharp\!\int \simeq \int, \qquad
\int\!\flat \simeq \flat, \qquad
\int\!\sharp \simeq \flat,
$$

$$
\flat\!\sharp = (\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma)\circ(\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma)
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ(\Gamma\circ\mathrm{coDisc})\circ\Gamma
\simeq \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma = \flat,
$$

$$
\sharp\!\flat = (\mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma)\circ(\mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma)
\simeq \mathrm{coDisc}\circ(\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc})\circ\Gamma
\simeq \mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma = \sharp.
$$

Since every pairwise product in $\{\int,\flat,\sharp\}$ reduces to a single element of
that set, induction on chain length shows every finite composition
$M_1\circ\cdots\circ M_k$ reduces to one of $\{\int,\flat,\sharp\}$. No new modality
arises from finite composition.

**Case 4: Derived modalities.** Beyond finite composition, two constructions yield
genuinely new structure:

- $\ast = \mathrm{colim}_{k}\,\int^{(k)}$: the transfinite iterate of $\int$,
  stabilizing at the shape modality's fixed-point reflection (the
  $\int$-localization). This captures recursive self-reduction structure.
- $\partial = \mathrm{fib}(\eta_\sharp : \mathrm{id}\to\sharp)$: the homotopy fiber
  of the sharp unit. This captures boundary/interface structure.

**Case 5: Closure of derived modalities.** We verify that compositions involving $\ast$
and $\partial$ do not produce a sixth modality:

- *$\ast$ absorbs basic modalities:* Since $\ast$ is the $\int$-localization
  (the terminal coalgebra of $\int$), $\int\!\ast\simeq\ast$ and
  $\ast\!\int\simeq\ast$. By the reduction identities, $\flat\!\ast =
  \flat\circ\mathrm{colim}_k\int^{(k)}\simeq\mathrm{colim}_k(\flat\!\int^{(k)})
  \simeq\mathrm{colim}_k\int^{(k)} = \ast$ (using $\flat\!\int\simeq\int$ applied as
  $\flat \circ \int \circ \int^{(k-1)} \simeq \int \circ \int^{(k-1)} = \int^{(k)}$
  at each step). Similarly $\sharp\!\ast\simeq\ast$: since $\ast X$ is
  $\int$-local, $\ast X\simeq\mathrm{Disc}(S)$ for some $S$. Under strong
  cohesion, $\sharp(\mathrm{Disc}(S)) = \mathrm{coDisc}(\Gamma(\mathrm{Disc}(S)))
  = \mathrm{coDisc}(S) \simeq \mathrm{Disc}(S) = \ast X$ (this avoids pushing
  $\sharp = \mathrm{coDisc}\circ\Gamma$, a right adjoint, through the colimit).
  For the reverse order:
  $\ast\!\flat\simeq\flat$ and $\ast\!\sharp\simeq\flat$. For $\ast\!\flat$:
  since $\int(\flat X)\simeq\flat X$ (by $\int\!\flat\simeq\flat$), $\flat X$ is
  already $\int$-local, so $\ast(\flat X) = \flat X$; hence
  $\ast\circ\flat\simeq\flat$. For $\ast\!\sharp$: $\int(\sharp X)\simeq\flat X$
  (by $\int\!\sharp\simeq\flat$), and then
  $\int^{(2)}(\sharp X) = \int(\int(\sharp X))\simeq\int(\flat X)\simeq\flat X$.
  By induction $\int^{(k)}(\sharp X)\simeq\flat X$ for all $k\ge 1$; the colimit
  of a constant diagram is $\flat X$, so $\ast\circ\sharp\simeq\flat$.
  (Under strong cohesion $\flat\simeq\sharp$, so equivalently
  $\ast\circ\sharp\simeq\sharp$.) The completeness conclusion is unaffected since
  $\flat$ is already in the generating set.
- *$\partial^2\simeq\partial$:* The fiber construction $\partial =
  \mathrm{fib}(\eta_\sharp)$ is idempotent. An object $X$ is $\sharp$-modal iff
  $\partial X \simeq 0$, so $\partial X$ lies in the $\sharp$-anti-modal subcategory.
  Applying $\partial$ again: $\partial(\partial X) =
  \mathrm{fib}(\eta_\sharp\colon\partial X\to\sharp\partial X)$. But $\partial X$ is
  already $\sharp$-anti-modal, meaning $\sharp(\partial X)\simeq 0$ (the
  $\sharp$-reflection of a $\sharp$-anti-modal object is terminal). Hence
  $\partial(\partial X)\simeq\mathrm{fib}(\partial X\to 0)\simeq\partial X$.
- *$\ast\circ\partial$:* Consider the fiber sequence
  $\partial X \to X \xrightarrow{\eta_\sharp} \sharp X$. Since $\int$ is a left exact
  modality (lex modality) in a cohesive $\infty$-topos, it preserves fiber sequences.
  Applying $\int$ gives a fiber sequence
  $\int(\partial X)\to\int X\xrightarrow{\int(\eta_\sharp)}\int(\sharp X)$. Under
  strong cohesion ({prf:ref}`rem-strong-cohesion-requirement`),
  $\int(\sharp X)\simeq\flat X$ (by $\int\!\sharp\simeq\flat$), so
  $\int(\partial X)\simeq\mathrm{fib}(\int X\to\flat X)$. Note that the map
  $\int(\eta_\sharp)\colon\int X\to\flat X$ is the canonical comparison
  $\mathrm{Disc}(\Pi(X))\to\mathrm{Disc}(\Gamma(X))$; this is *not* generally
  an equivalence ($\Pi\ne\Gamma$ in general — e.g., for $S^1$ in smooth
  $\infty$-groupoids, $\Pi(S^1)=B\mathbb{Z}$ while $\Gamma(S^1)=\mathrm{pt}$;
  "pieces have points" gives only an epi $\Gamma\to\Pi$, not an equivalence).
  Therefore $\ast\circ\partial$ reduces but does not necessarily vanish:
  $\ast(\partial X)$ lives in the $\int$-localization of
  $\mathrm{fib}(\int X\to\flat X)$, a derived object built from $\int$ and $\flat$
  via the fiber construction. This object lies within
  $\mathrm{Sat}\langle\int,\flat,\sharp\rangle$, so no sixth modality arises.
  Note that the $\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}$ separation argument does *not* depend
  on $\ast\circ\partial\simeq 0$: its critical path is primitive step
  classification $\to$ per-channel blockage $\to$ non-amplification, which relies
  on the compositional closure taxonomy rather than this particular identity.
- *$\partial\circ\ast$:* Since $\ast X$ is $\int$-local, the identity
  $\flat\!\int\simeq\int$ implies that $\ast X$ is $\flat$-modal (the counit
  $\flat(\ast X)\to\ast X$ is an equivalence, because $\int$-local objects lie in
  the essential image of $\mathrm{Disc}$, and $\flat\circ\mathrm{Disc} =
  \mathrm{Disc}\circ\Gamma\circ\mathrm{Disc}\simeq\mathrm{Disc}$). To conclude
  that $\ast X$ is also $\sharp$-modal, we need the equivalence
  $\mathrm{Disc}(S) \simeq \mathrm{coDisc}(S)$ for discrete $S$. Concretely,
  for $\ast X\simeq\mathrm{Disc}(S)$ we have
  $\sharp(\mathrm{Disc}(S)) = \mathrm{coDisc}(\Gamma(\mathrm{Disc}(S)))
  \simeq\mathrm{coDisc}(S)$, and the unit
  $\mathrm{Disc}(S)\to\mathrm{coDisc}(S)$ is an equivalence precisely when the
  topos satisfies **strong cohesion** ($\mathrm{Disc} \simeq \mathrm{coDisc}$ on
  discrete types). This condition does *not* follow from the three cohesion axioms
  listed in {prf:ref}`def-cohesive-topos-computation` alone; it is an additional
  property satisfied by all cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes arising from differential
  cohesion (see {prf:ref}`rem-strong-cohesion-requirement` below and Schreiber,
  *Differential cohomology in a cohesive $\infty$-topos*, Prop. 3.8.8;
  note that numbering may vary between manuscript versions). Therefore
  $\partial(\ast X) = \mathrm{fib}(\eta_\sharp\colon\ast X\to\sharp\ast X)
  \simeq\mathrm{fib}(\mathrm{id})\simeq 0$. Hence $\partial\circ\ast\simeq 0$
  (the zero modality, a trivial case).
- *$\ast\circ\ast\simeq\ast$:* Immediate since $\ast$ is already a localization
  (idempotent).
- *Compositions of $\partial$ with basic modalities:*
  $\partial\circ\int\simeq 0$: $\partial(\int X) =
  \mathrm{fib}(\int X\to\sharp(\int X))$, and $\sharp\!\int\simeq\int$ under
  strong cohesion, so this is $\mathrm{fib}(\int X\to\int X)\simeq 0$.
  $\partial\circ\flat\simeq 0$: $\partial(\flat X) =
  \mathrm{fib}(\flat X\to\sharp(\flat X))$. Since $\sharp\!\flat\simeq\sharp$ and
  under strong cohesion $\flat\simeq\sharp$, this is
  $\mathrm{fib}(\sharp X\to\sharp X)\simeq 0$.
  $\partial\circ\sharp\simeq 0$: $\partial(\sharp X) =
  \mathrm{fib}(\sharp X\to\sharp(\sharp X)) = \mathrm{fib}(\sharp X\to\sharp X)
  \simeq 0$ ($\sharp$ is idempotent).
  $\sharp\circ\partial\simeq 0$: already stated ($\sharp(\partial X)\simeq 0$
  since $\partial X$ is $\sharp$-anti-modal).
  $\flat\circ\partial\simeq 0$: under strong cohesion $\flat\simeq\sharp$, so
  $\flat\circ\partial\simeq\sharp\circ\partial\simeq 0$.
  $\int\circ\partial$: $\int(\partial X) = \int(\mathrm{fib}(X\to\sharp X))$.
  Since $\int$ is left exact, $\int(\partial X)\simeq\mathrm{fib}(\int X\to
  \int(\sharp X))\simeq\mathrm{fib}(\int X\to\flat X)$, which lies in
  $\mathrm{Sat}\langle\int,\flat\rangle$. Thus $\partial$ composed with any basic
  modality gives $0$, and the basic modalities composed with $\partial$ either give
  $0$ or objects in $\mathrm{Sat}\langle\int,\flat\rangle$; no sixth modality
  arises.

**Conclusion.** Every endofunctor on $\mathcal{H}$ built from the adjoint quadruple —
whether by finite composition, transfinite iteration, or fiber construction — either
reduces to one of $\{\mathrm{id},\int,\flat,\sharp,\ast,\partial\}$ or to a derived
object lying within $\mathrm{Sat}\langle\int,\flat,\sharp\rangle$ (e.g., the
$\ast\circ\partial$ and $\int\circ\partial$ cases, which produce fibers of maps
between objects already in the generating set). In particular, no sixth independent
modality arises: the five non-trivial modalities
$\{\int,\flat,\sharp,\ast,\partial\}$ are complete.

:::{prf:remark} Strong cohesion requirement for five-modality completeness
:label: rem-strong-cohesion-requirement

The completeness of the five modalities $(\int, \flat, \sharp, \ast, \partial)$
established in {prf:ref}`rem-five-modality-completeness-argument` relies on
**strong cohesion** ($\mathrm{Disc}(S) \simeq \mathrm{coDisc}(S)$ for discrete
types $S$) in several places: the $\partial\circ\ast\simeq 0$ identity, the
$\sharp\circ\ast\simeq\ast$ identity, and the reduction identities
$\flat\circ\partial\simeq 0$ and $\partial\circ\flat\simeq 0$. This condition is
not a consequence of the three basic cohesion axioms in
{prf:ref}`def-cohesive-topos-computation`. It is, however, satisfied by all
cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes that arise from models of differential cohesion
(e.g., smooth $\infty$-groupoids, formal moduli problems), which are the models
relevant to this document.

Note that $\ast\circ\partial$ does *not* reduce to $0$ in general: the fiber
$\mathrm{fib}(\int X\to\flat X)$ need not vanish since $\Pi\ne\Gamma$ for
general objects. However, $\ast\circ\partial$ produces objects within
$\mathrm{Sat}\langle\int,\flat,\sharp\rangle$ (built from fibers of maps between
objects already in the generating set), so no sixth independent modality arises.
The complexity-theoretic consequences of the five-modality classification therefore
carry a dependence on the strong cohesion axiom. See {cite}`SchreiberCohesive`,
Section 3.8, for the relationship between strong cohesion and locality.

:::{prf:lemma} Modal decomposition under 0-truncation
:label: lem-zero-truncation-modal-preservation

The modal decomposition of {prf:ref}`cor-exhaustive-decomposition`, when restricted
to $0$-truncated objects with finite polynomial-size presentations (the
complexity-theoretic fragment per {prf:ref}`rem-ambient-conventions-complexity`),
retains the exhaustive five-way classification. That is, no polynomial-time-exploitable
structure is lost by restricting to the $0$-truncated, finitely presented fragment.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The modalities $\int$, $\flat$, $\sharp$ preserve $n$-truncatedness for all
$n \ge -1$. This holds because the left and right adjoints of $\mathrm{Disc}$
preserve truncation levels ({cite}`SchreiberCohesive`, Proposition 3.8.2). In
particular, they preserve $0$-truncatedness: if $\mathcal{X}$ is $0$-truncated
(a set), then $\int\mathcal{X}$, $\flat\mathcal{X}$, $\sharp\mathcal{X}$ are
$0$-truncated.

The derived modalities $\ast$ and $\partial$ are built from $\int$ and $\sharp$
respectively by colimits and fibers. For types that are already $0$-truncated in
an $(\infty,1)$-topos, fibers of maps between $0$-truncated types are $0$-truncated,
and filtered colimits of $0$-truncated types remain $0$-truncated. Therefore $\ast$
and $\partial$ also preserve $0$-truncatedness.

Since all five modalities preserve $0$-truncatedness, the fracture squares and
the pullback decomposition of {prf:ref}`cor-exhaustive-decomposition` remain valid
within the $0$-truncated fragment. The finite-presentation condition is preserved
because presentation translators are polynomial-time maps between finite structures,
and the modal maps in the fracture squares are constructive and polynomial-time
when restricted to finitely presented objects (the adjoints $\Pi$, $\Gamma$ applied
to finitely presented types yield finitely presented outputs).

:::{prf:remark} Proof Status and Classical Export
:label: rem-conditional-status-classical-export

The $P\neq NP$ result proved in this document is a theorem within a chosen foundation.

**Foundational choice:** We work in cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos theory
({prf:ref}`axiom-structure-thesis`). This is a foundational choice analogous to choosing
ZFC + large cardinals as the ambient set theory. It selects the mathematical universe in
which the proof operates.

**Proved theorems within this foundation:**

1. **Bridge equivalence** ({prf:ref}`cor-bridge-equivalence-rigorous`):
   $P_{\text{FM}} = P_{\text{DTM}}$ and $NP_{\text{FM}} = NP_{\text{DTM}}$.
   This is a rigorous theorem establishing that the internal complexity classes
   coincide with the classical Turing-machine classes.

2. **Internal separation** ({prf:ref}`cor-pfm-neq-npfm-from-random-3sat`):
   $P_{\text{FM}} \neq NP_{\text{FM}}$.
   This is a rigorous theorem proved via the E13 certificate chain and the
   five-modality obstruction framework.

**Classical export:** Combining these two theorems yields
$P_{\text{DTM}} \neq NP_{\text{DTM}}$
({prf:ref}`cor-internal-to-classical-separation`). The proof is valid within the
chosen foundation, and the bridge theorems certify that the result applies to
classical computation.

The specific topos-theoretic structures used (five modalities, fracture squares,
modal decomposition) could in principle be exported to a ZFC proof by replacing the
topos-theoretic language with explicit combinatorial definitions of the five
algorithmic paradigms.

### Algorithm Classification via Cohesive Modalities

:::{prf:remark} Ambient conventions for complexity-theoretic use of the cohesive framework
:label: rem-ambient-conventions-complexity

Throughout this subsection, $\mathbf{H}$ denotes the fixed cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos from
{prf:ref}`def-five-modalities`, and $\mathsf{Prog}_{\text{FM}}$ and $\mathsf{Eval}$ are as in
{prf:ref}`def-effective-programs-fragile`.

To speak rigorously about complexity classes, we restrict attention to externally presented, $0$-truncated objects.
Concretely, whenever complexity is discussed, an object $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbf{H}$ is used only through its
externally presented set of global points $\Gamma(\mathcal{X})$, together with a finite encoding. For readability, we
write $x \in X_n$ to mean $x \in \Gamma(X_n)$.

We fix once and for all:
1. a self-delimiting pairing function

   $$
   \langle -,- \rangle : \{0,1\}^* \times \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}^*
   $$

   with polynomial-time computable projections $\pi_1,\pi_2$;
2. a standard binary encoding of integers $n \mapsto \ulcorner n \urcorner$ computable and decodable in polynomial
   time;
3. the convention that every polynomial means a function $p:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ with nonnegative integer
   coefficients.

All complexity bounds below are taken with respect to the size parameter $n$ indexing the input family. Because every
admissible encoding length is polynomially bounded in $n$, this is equivalent up to polynomial distortion to measuring
time in terms of encoded bitlength.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Operational content of modal restrictions on 0-truncated types
:label: rem-modal-restrictions-finite-type

In the abstract cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos $\mathbf{H}$, the modal units
$\eta^\sharp : \mathrm{id} \to \sharp$, $\eta^{\int} : \mathrm{id} \to \int$, and
$\eta^\flat : \mathrm{id} \to \flat$ act *trivially* on discrete (0-truncated) objects: for a
discrete set $S$, $\sharp S = \mathrm{coDisc}(\Gamma(S)) \simeq S$ and
$\int S = \mathrm{Disc}(\Pi(S)) \simeq S$ (since $\Gamma$ and $\Pi$ are both the identity on
discrete types, and $\mathrm{Disc}$ and $\mathrm{coDisc}$ embed sets into the topos with
trivial/maximal structure respectively). Consequently, the abstract factorization
$F = g \circ \eta^\sharp$ is vacuously satisfied by every map on a discrete type.

Since all complexity-theoretic objects are 0-truncated and accessed through $\Gamma(\mathcal{X})$
with finite bitstring encodings ({prf:ref}`rem-ambient-conventions-complexity`), the
**operational content** of the modal restrictions in items 6 (of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`) and 7 (of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`) is carried entirely by their **"Concretely" clauses**,
which specify explicit computational restrictions:

- **$\sharp$-modal restriction (item 6)**: $F_n^\sharp(z)$ is determined by a **metric profile**
  $\mu_n^\sharp(z) \in \{0,\ldots,q_\sharp(n)\}^{D+2}$ consisting of the rank value
  $V_n^\sharp(z)$, the energy $\Phi(z)$, and at most $D$ additional gradient/curvature quantities,
  where $D$ is a **universal constant independent of $n$**
  (see {prf:ref}`rem-constant-D-metric-profile`). The profile is insensitive to constraint-graph
  connectivity ($\int$-type) and algebraic identities ($\flat$-type).

- **$\int$-modal restriction (item 8)**: Each $U_{n,i}$ computes by forward causal propagation:
  it acts on dependency-graph connectivity, predecessor-successor relationships, and
  constraint-propagation paths, and is insensitive to metric quantities ($\sharp$-type) and
  algebraic identities ($\flat$-type) beyond what is accessible through the causal structure.

These concrete specifications are **the formal definitions** for the complexity-theoretic setting.
The topos-theoretic factorization language ($F = g \circ \eta^\sharp$, $U = \tilde{U} \circ \eta^{\int}$)
serves as *categorical motivation* for why the five modalities exhaust all structure
({prf:ref}`thm-schreiber-structure`), but the obstruction proofs use only the concrete
computational restrictions. In particular:

1. The sharp obstruction ({prf:ref}`lem-sharp-obstruction`) uses that $F_n^\sharp$ is determined
   by a $(D+2)$-tuple of polynomial-bounded metric quantities (rank, energy, and $D$ additional
   gradient/curvature values), where $D$ is a universal constant. This gives a polynomial upper
   bound $|\mathrm{Im}(\mu_n^\sharp)| \leq q_\sharp(n)^{D+2} = \mathrm{poly}(n)$ on the number
   of distinct behaviors — a purely combinatorial consequence of the concrete $\sharp$-modal
   specification and the constant dimensionality of the profile.

2. The causal obstruction ({prf:ref}`lem-causal-arbitrary-poset-transfer`) uses that $U_{n,i}$
   cannot invoke optimization, algebraic elimination, or divide-and-conquer subroutines — a
   computational restriction specified concretely in item 8.

This separation of concerns — topos-theoretic classification for exhaustiveness, concrete
computational restrictions for obstruction proofs — avoids the issue that abstract modal units
are trivial on discrete types. The topos framework provides the *taxonomy* (why five modalities
and not six); the concrete specifications provide the *content* (what each modality can and
cannot compute). The Computational Foundation
({prf:ref}`axiom-structure-thesis`) bridges these two levels.

:::{prf:remark} Encoding freedom does not circumvent modal restrictions
:label: rem-encoding-freedom-does-not-circumvent

A natural concern is that the encoding map $E_n^\lozenge$ — which is an arbitrary polynomial-time
map ({prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract`) — could smuggle non-$\lozenge$ information into
the $\lozenge$-workspace, thereby defeating the modal restrictions. We address this concern
channel by channel.

**$\sharp$-channel.** The encoding $E_n^\sharp$ may place arbitrary information into $Z_n^\sharp$;
in principle, it could encode the entire formula. However, item 6 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous` requires that $F_n^\sharp$ factor as
$F_n^\sharp = g_n \circ \eta_n^\sharp$, so the output $F_n^\sharp(z)$ is determined by the
metric profile

$$
\mu_n^\sharp(z) \;\in\; \{0,\ldots,q_\sharp(n)\}^{D+2},
$$

a $(D+2)$-dimensional tuple of polynomial-bounded values (rank, energy, and $D$ gradient/curvature
quantities), where $D$ is a universal constant independent of $n$. Two states $z_1, z_2$ with
$\mu_n^\sharp(z_1) = \mu_n^\sharp(z_2)$ must satisfy $F_n^\sharp(z_1) = F_n^\sharp(z_2)$. Even if
$E_n^\sharp$ packs the full formula into $Z_n^\sharp$, the metric profile $\mu_n^\sharp$ extracts
only $D+2 = O(1)$ polynomial-bounded quantities; the smuggled information is present in
$Z_n^\sharp$ but **invisible** to $F_n^\sharp$, because $F_n^\sharp$ factors through
$\mu_n^\sharp$. The encoding freedom determines *what* the metric data looks like; the profile
factorization determines *how much* the core map can see.

**$\int$-channel.** The encoding $E_n^{\int}$ may place arbitrary information into each site's
initial state. However, item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous` requires that $U_{n,i}$
access only predecessor states $(\mathrm{state}_j)_{j \in \mathrm{Pred}(i)}$ and visible clauses
$\mathrm{Vis}(i)$. Even if $E_n^{\int}$ packs the full formula into a predecessor's state, $U_{n,i}$
can only read that predecessor's state value — the $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$ restriction limits *which
clauses* are accessible, regardless of what the encoding places there. An adversary could try to pack
the full formula into site $0$'s state (the root), but then only site $0$'s immediate successors can
read it as predecessor data. The $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$ restriction still prevents later sites from
accessing clauses whose variables lie at incomparable positions in the poset.

**$\partial$-channel.** The encoding $E_n^\partial$ may place arbitrary information into the
interface $B_n^\partial$. However, the interface has $q_\partial(n)$ bits, and item 7 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous` restricts $C_n^\partial$ to read/write only interface
bits and compose boundary maps. The key restriction is not what is *in* the interface, but what
$C_n^\partial$ can *do* with it: $C_n^\partial$ cannot invoke $\sharp$-type optimization,
$\int$-type propagation, $\flat$-type elimination, or $\ast$-type decomposition — these mechanisms
require access to the full input, not just the interface. Even if the interface contains the full
formula, $C_n^\partial$ is restricted to local interface operations and cannot reach back into the
bulk.

In each case, the encoding determines the *content* of the workspace; the factorization requirement
determines the *access* the core map has to that content. Smuggling information into the workspace
is futile because the modal restriction governs what the core map can extract, not what the
workspace contains.

:::{prf:definition} Admissible family of inputs

(\chi^{\mathfrak{X}}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}

$$

consisting of the following data.

1. **Size-indexed objects.** For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $X_n \in \mathbf{H}$ is $0$-truncated.
2. **Encoding-length bound.** $m_{\mathfrak{X}}:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ is a polynomial.
3. **Injective finite encoding.** For each $n$ there is an injective map

   $$
   \mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n : X_n \hookrightarrow \{0,1\}^{m_{\mathfrak{X}}(n)}.
   $$

4. **Decidable image.** For each $n$ there is a predicate

   $$
   \chi^{\mathfrak{X}}_n : \{0,1\}^{m_{\mathfrak{X}}(n)} \to \{0,1\}
   $$

   such that

   $$
   \chi^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(u)=1
   \iff
   u \in \mathrm{im}(\mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n).
   $$

5. **Polynomial-time decoding on valid codes.** For each $n$ there is a total map

   $$
   \mathrm{dec}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n :
   \{\,u \in \{0,1\}^{m_{\mathfrak{X}}(n)} : \chi^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(u)=1\,\}
   \to X_n
   $$

   satisfying

   $$
   \mathrm{dec}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(\mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(x)) = x
   \quad\text{for all }x\in X_n,
   $$

   and

   $$
   \mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(\mathrm{dec}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(u)) = u
   \quad\text{for all valid }u.
   $$

6. **Uniform realizability.** There exist single effective procedures computing:
   - $n \mapsto m_{\mathfrak{X}}(n)$,
   - $(n,x) \mapsto \mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(x)$,
   - $(n,u) \mapsto \chi^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(u)$,
   - $(n,u) \mapsto \mathrm{dec}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(u)$ on valid codes,

   each in time polynomial in $n$ and the input bitlength.

The associated **valid code language** of $\mathfrak{X}$ is

$$
D_{\mathfrak{X}}
:=
\left\{
\left\langle \ulcorner n\urcorner,\mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(x)\right\rangle
\,:\,
n\in\mathbb{N},\ x\in X_n
\right\}

A family of outputs is admissible by the same definition.

:::{prf:remark} On the word "canonical"
:label: rem-canonical-means-fixed-admissible

In complexity-theoretic arguments, the phrase "canonical encoding" is too vague. In the present framework, one should
never argue using an unspecified canonical code. The admissible encoding is part of the structure of the family
$\mathfrak{X}$.

The correct invariance statement is not "there is one canonical encoding", but rather: any two admissible encodings of
the same underlying size-indexed family are polynomially intertranslatable. That is the content of the next lemma.
:::

:::{prf:lemma} Encoding invariance for admissible families

Let

$$
\mathfrak{X}
=

\quad\text{and}\quad
\mathfrak{X}'
=
\bigl((X_n),m',\mathrm{enc}',\mathrm{dec}',\chi'\bigr)
$$

be two admissible presentations of the same underlying size-indexed family $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$.

Then there exist uniform polynomial-time translators

$$
T_{\mathfrak{X}\to\mathfrak{X}'}(n,u)
:=
\mathrm{enc}'_n(\mathrm{dec}_n(u)),
\qquad
T_{\mathfrak{X}'\to\mathfrak{X}}(n,v)
:=
\mathrm{enc}_n(\mathrm{dec}'_n(v)),
$$

defined on valid codes, and these translators are mutual inverses on valid inputs.

Consequently, the choice of admissible encoding changes time complexity by at most polynomial overhead.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Because $\mathfrak{X}$ is admissible, $\mathrm{dec}_n$ is uniformly polynomial-time computable on the valid image of
$\mathrm{enc}_n$. Because $\mathfrak{X}'$ is admissible, $\mathrm{enc}'_n$ is uniformly polynomial-time computable on
$X_n$. Therefore the composition

$$
u \mapsto \mathrm{enc}'_n(\mathrm{dec}_n(u))
$$

is uniformly polynomial-time on valid $u$.

The same argument yields polynomial-time computability of $T_{\mathfrak{X}'\to\mathfrak{X}}$. The inverse identities
follow immediately from the inverse axioms in {prf:ref}`def-admissible-input-family-rigorous`.

$$

such that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and every $x\in X_n$:

1. the evaluation

   $$
   \mathsf{Eval}\!\left(a,\left\langle \ulcorner n\urcorner,\mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(x)\right\rangle\right)

   terminates with some bitstring output $v$;
2. the output is a valid $\mathfrak{Y}$-code of size $\sigma(n)$:

   $$
   \chi^{\mathfrak{Y}}_{\sigma(n)}(v)=1;
   $$

3. the induced extensional map

   $$
   \mathcal{A}_n : X_n \to Y_{\sigma(n)}

   is defined by

   $$
   \mathcal{A}_n(x)

The key point is **uniformity**: the code object $a$ is fixed once and for all and is independent of $n$. In
particular, no non-uniform advice string depending on $n$ is permitted.

When $\sigma(n)=n$, we simply write

$$
\mathcal{A} : \mathfrak{X}\Rightarrow \mathfrak{Y}.

   \Pi_{\lozenge}(F^{\lozenge})

They must also satisfy the **$\lozenge$-supportedness** property.
In the linearized trace context ({prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition`), each pure
$\lozenge$-step is promoted to an endomorphism of the global state
$\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$ via the transported map
$F^{\lozenge}_* \colon \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} \to \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$.
The $\lozenge$-supportedness property requires: for any $\lozenge'$-modal map
$q \colon \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} \to W$ (where $\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$ ranges over the
other four modalities),

$$
q \circ F^{\lozenge}_* \;=\; q.
$$

That is, the transported endomorphism is invisible to all $\lozenge'$-modal observations.
A map $q$ is $\lozenge'$-modal if it factors through the product projection
$\pi_{\lozenge'} \colon \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} \to Z_n^{\lozenge'}$, i.e.,
$q = \hat{q} \circ \pi_{\lozenge'}$ for some $\hat{q}$.

In words: the encode-compute-reconstruct pipeline for channel $\lozenge$ is invisible to every
other modality's observations. This is the formal expression of "purity" — a pure $\lozenge$-step only affects
$\lozenge$-data. An algorithm step that reads $\sharp$-data and writes to $\int$-workspace is not a "pure $\sharp$-step";
it is a mixed step.

The witness is called **pure** because all asymptotically nontrivial work is carried by the single middle family
$F^{\lozenge}$, while $E^{\lozenge}$ and $R^{\lozenge}$ are required to be presentation translators rather than
arbitrary polynomial-time algorithms. The $\lozenge$-supportedness property strengthens this: not only does all
nontrivial work occur in $F^{\lozenge}$, but the entire encode-compute-reconstruct pipeline is invisible to every
other channel's modal observations.

admits a **pure $\sharp$-witness** if it admits a pure modal witness in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract` with $\lozenge=\sharp$, and the modality-specific certificate
$\Pi_{\sharp}(F^\sharp)$ consists of:

1. a decidable family of solved states

   $$
   S_n^\sharp \subseteq Z^\sharp_n;
   $$

2. a polynomial $q_\sharp$ and a uniformly polynomial-time ranking function

   $$
   V_n^\sharp : Z_n^\sharp \to \mathbb{N}
   $$

   satisfying

   $$
   V_n^\sharp(z)\le q_\sharp(n)
   \qquad
   \text{for all }z\in Z_n^\sharp;
   $$

3. a fixed-point condition on solved states:

   $$
   z\in S_n^\sharp \implies F_n^\sharp(z)=z;
   $$

4. a strict progress condition off the solved set:

   $$
   z\notin S_n^\sharp
   \implies
   V_n^\sharp(F_n^\sharp(z)) \le V_n^\sharp(z)-1;
   $$

5. a correctness condition: if

   $$
   t_n(x)
   :=
   \min\{\,t\le q_\sharp(\rho_\sharp(n)) : (F_{\rho_\sharp(n)}^\sharp)^t(E_n^\sharp(x))\in S_{\rho_\sharp(n)}^\sharp\,\},
   $$

   then

   \mathcal{A}_n(x)
   =
   R_n^\sharp\!\left((F_{\rho_\sharp(n)}^\sharp)^{t_n(x)}(E_n^\sharp(x))\right).
   $$

6. a **$\sharp$-modal restriction** on the transition map: $F_n^\sharp$ factors through the $\sharp$
   modality in the ambient cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos. Concretely, the computation of $F_n^\sharp(z)$
   at each step is determined by a **metric profile** $\mu_n^\sharp(z)$ consisting of a *fixed finite
   number* of polynomial-bounded quantities: the rank value $V_n^\sharp(z)$, the energy $\Phi(z)$, and
   at most $D$ gradient/curvature quantities (where $D$ is a **universal constant independent of $n$**).
   Formally,

   $$
   \mu_n^\sharp(z) \;\in\; \{0,\ldots,q_\sharp(n)\}^{D+2},
   $$

   and $F_n^\sharp$ factors through $\mu_n^\sharp$: two states with the same metric profile receive the
   same transition,

   $$
   \mu_n^\sharp(z_1) = \mu_n^\sharp(z_2)
   \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
   F_n^\sharp(z_1) = F_n^\sharp(z_2).
   $$

   This factorization ensures that two states with identical metric profiles receive identical
   treatment, **regardless of what non-metric information the encoding $E_n^\sharp$ may have placed
   in the lifted state $Z_n^\sharp$** (see {prf:ref}`rem-encoding-freedom-does-not-circumvent`).

   The $D+2$ components are the rank value, the energy, and $D$ additional metric/potential quantities
   (e.g., directional energy differences, local curvature estimates) — but **not** $\int$-type
   information (constraint-graph connectivity, implication-chain topology, message-passing convergence
   properties) and **not** $\flat$-type information (algebraic identities among solution components,
   symmetry-group structure). In the topos-theoretic language, $F_n^\sharp$ lies in the image of the
   $\sharp$-unit $\eta^\sharp: \mathrm{id} \to \sharp$, meaning it factors as
   $F_n^\sharp = g_n \circ \eta^\sharp_n$ for some $g_n: \sharp Z_n^\sharp \to Z_n^\sharp$.
   Here $\eta^\sharp_n : Z_n^\sharp \to \sharp Z_n^\sharp$ is the $\sharp$-unit that projects each state
   to its metric profile $\mu_n^\sharp(z)$, discarding $\int$-type (constraint-graph connectivity) and
   $\flat$-type (algebraic identity) information. Since $D$ is a universal constant, the number of
   distinct metric profiles is

   $$
   |\mathrm{Im}(\mu_n^\sharp)| \;\leq\; q_\sharp(n)^{D+2} \;=\; \mathrm{poly}(n),
   $$

   which is polynomial in $n$ — a property essential for the pigeonhole argument in
   {prf:ref}`lem-sharp-obstruction`.

Intuitively, pure $\sharp$-computation is computation by certified descent in a polynomially bounded potential, where the transition map is explicitly restricted to act only on metric/potential data and cannot access shape or flat structure of the state space.

   U_{n,i}

   of $\prec_n$ such that

   $$
   \mathcal{A}_n
   =
   R_n^\int \circ F_{\rho_\int(n)}^\int \circ E_n^\int.

7. a **site–variable assignment map**

   $$
   \sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}} : [n] \;\longrightarrow\; P_n
   $$

   that assigns each SAT variable $x_j$ ($j \in [n]$) to a poset site
   $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(j) \in P_n$. The map $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}$ is part of the witness
   data and is uniformly polynomial-time computable. When $P_n = [n]$ with the natural ordering,
   $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}} = \mathrm{id}$ recovers the original variable–site identification.

8. an **$\int$-modal restriction** on the update maps: each $U_{n,i}$ factors through the $\int$ (shape)
   modality in the ambient cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos. Formally, $U_{n,i}$
   lies in the image of the $\int$-unit $\eta^{\int}$: there exists $\tilde{U}_{n,i}$ such that
   $U_{n,i} = \tilde{U}_{n,i} \circ \eta^{\int}_n$, where $\eta^{\int}_n$ projects the input data to
   its shape/causal structure.

   Concretely, $U_{n,i}$ computes by **forward causal propagation**, defined by the following
   positive information restriction. Let $\mathrm{Pred}(i) := \{j \in P_n : j \prec_n i\}$ denote
   the predecessor set of site $i$. Define the **visible clause set** at site $i$ via the
   site–variable assignment $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}$ (item 7):

   $$
   \mathrm{Vis}(i) \;:=\; \bigl\{C \in \mathcal{C}_n :
   \sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}\!\bigl(\operatorname{var}(C)\bigr) \subseteq \mathrm{Pred}(i) \cup \{i\}\bigr\},
   $$

   where $\mathcal{C}_n$ is the set of constraints in the encoded input,
   $\operatorname{var}(C) \subseteq [n]$ is the variable set of constraint $C$, and
   $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}\!\bigl(\operatorname{var}(C)\bigr) := \{\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(j) : j \in \operatorname{var}(C)\}$
   denotes the image of the variable set under the assignment map. A clause $C$ is visible at site $i$
   if and only if **all** its variables are assigned (under $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}$) to predecessors
   of $i$ or to $i$ itself.

   **Clause-structured encoding.** The encoding $E_n^{\int}$ must be **clause-structured**: the
   bitstring representation partitions into clause-indexed segments
   $E_n^{\int}(x) = (b_{C_1}, b_{C_2}, \ldots, b_{C_m})$ where each $b_{C_k}$ encodes constraint
   $C_k \in \mathcal{C}_n$ and is individually addressable. This ensures that "restriction of the
   encoded input to $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$" is well-defined as the sub-bitstring
   $(b_C)_{C \in \mathrm{Vis}(i)}$. This is a natural requirement: standard SAT encodings
   (DIMACS, adjacency-list representations) are clause-structured.

   The $\int$-modal restriction requires that $U_{n,i}$'s
   output is a function of:

   - the predecessor state values $(\mathrm{state}_j)_{j \in \mathrm{Pred}(i)}$, and
   - the restriction of the encoded input to the visible clause set $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$,

   and **nothing else**. This supersedes the blanket input access in item 4: $U_{n,i}$ does not
   receive the entire encoded input, but only the clause-indexed segments corresponding to
   $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$. That is, $U_{n,i}$ is measurable with respect to the $\sigma$-algebra
   generated by $\{(\mathrm{state}_j)_{j \in \mathrm{Pred}(i)},\; \mathcal{C}_n|_{\mathrm{Vis}(i)}\}$.
   In particular, $U_{n,i}$ cannot read or condition on:

   - constraints $C \notin \mathrm{Vis}(i)$ whose variables include sites not yet processed
     (successor or incomparable sites), and
   - state values $\mathrm{state}_j$ for $j \not\prec_n i$ (non-predecessor sites).

   This is a well-defined information restriction: it specifies exactly what data $U_{n,i}$ may access
   (predecessor values and visible constraints) and excludes everything else. The restriction captures
   the essence of "forward causal propagation" — information flows forward along the poset, and each
   update sees only the constraints that are fully resolved by its predecessors.

   The encoding $E_n^{\int}$ determines the content of each site's initial state, but the
   $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$ restriction governs which data $U_{n,i}$ may read. Even if $E_n^{\int}$
   encodes the full formula into predecessor states, $U_{n,i}$ can only access the clause-indexed
   segments corresponding to $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$ — the encoding freedom determines *what* each
   segment contains, but the $\mathrm{Vis}(i)$ restriction determines *which* segments are
   accessible (see {prf:ref}`rem-encoding-freedom-does-not-circumvent`).

   Within the visible data, $U_{n,i}$ may perform **arbitrary polynomial-time computation** — it is
   not restricted in computational power, only in information access. This is analogous to the
   $\sharp$-modal restriction (item 6), which restricts information access to metric/potential data
   but allows arbitrary computation on that data.

Intuitively, pure $\int$-computation is computation by elimination along a polynomially bounded well-founded dependency
structure.

   $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ and the split metadata $s_n$, and its computation is restricted to
   *recombination operations* — assembling the global answer from sub-answers using only the
   structural information available from the splitting. Concretely: $\mathrm{merge}_n$ may read
   only the sub-answers $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$, the split coordinates $s_n$, and any recursion-tree
   metadata (subproblem sizes, split ratios). It **cannot** access the original input's constraint

   In the topos-theoretic language, $\mathrm{merge}_n$ lies in the image of the $\ast$-unit
   $\eta^\ast: \mathrm{id} \to \ast$, meaning it factors as

   (causal/dependency), and $\partial$-type (interface/separator) information about the original
   instance.

Intuitively, pure $\ast$-computation is certified polynomial-time self-reduction or divide-and-conquer with a
well-founded size decrease and polynomial total work, where the merge step is explicitly restricted to
recombination from sub-answers and cannot invoke constraint solving, metric search, dependency propagation,
or interface contraction on the original instance.

   middle contraction stage is polynomial in the interface description size and hence polynomial in $n$.

7. a **$\partial$-modal restriction** on the contraction map: $C_n^\partial$ factors through the
   $\partial$ (boundary/holographic) modality in the ambient cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos. Formally,
   $C_n^\partial$ lies in the image of the $\partial$-unit: there exists $\tilde{C}_n^\partial$ such
   that $C_n^\partial = \tilde{C}_n^\partial \circ \eta^{\partial}_n$, where $\eta^{\partial}_n$
   projects the encoded data to its boundary/interface structure.

   **$\partial$-modal restriction on the contraction.** Concretely, $C_n^\partial$ is restricted
   to **boundary-map compositions**: operations that manipulate the topology of the interface
   representation. It may perform the following on the polynomial-size interface object
   $B_n^\partial$:

   - **Read/write interface bits:** access and modify the $q_\partial(n)$-bit description of
     $B_n^\partial$ and any intermediate interface objects;
   - **Compose boundary maps:** apply sequences of boundary maps
     $\partial_i : B_{n,i}^\partial \to B_{n,i+1}^\partial$ between interface objects of
     description size bounded by $q_\partial(n)$, where each $\partial_i$ is a fixed
     polynomial-time function that transforms one interface representation into another;
   - **Local consistency propagation:** perform local consistency checks and information
     propagation on $O(1)$-neighborhoods of the interface topology — i.e., operations
     whose output at each interface position depends only on a bounded number of adjacent
     interface segments (gluing, splitting, re-indexing of boundary components, local
     consistency checks between adjacent interface segments).

   The $\partial$-modal restriction requires that $C_n^\partial$ operates **solely on the interface
   object** $B_n^\partial$ — it cannot re-access the original encoded input or the bulk interior
   state. Crucially, $C_n^\partial$ **cannot** perform:

   - $\flat$-type global constraint satisfaction (solving a CSP on the interface variables, algebraic
     elimination via Gaussian elimination or Gröbner bases on the constraint system encoded in the
     interface), even though the interface may encode constraint information;
   - $\sharp$-type metric optimization (energy minimization, gradient descent over assignment space
     derived from the interface data);
   - $\int$-type causal propagation (constraint propagation or belief propagation along the
     dependency graph encoded in the interface); or
   - $\ast$-type recursive decomposition (divide-and-conquer on the interface structure itself).

   These exclusions are **not** merely a consequence of lacking access to the original input — they
   are intrinsic to the $\partial$-modal restriction. Even though the interface $B_n^\partial$ may
   encode constraint information (crossing clauses, dependency edges, etc.), the contraction
   $C_n^\partial$ may only process this information through boundary-map compositions and local
   consistency propagation. It cannot treat the interface as a constraint system and solve it
   ($\flat$), optimize over it ($\sharp$), propagate through it globally ($\int$), or recursively
   decompose it ($\ast$). The restriction is on the *type of computation*, not merely on the
   *data accessible*.

Intuitively, pure $\partial$-computation is computation by reducing bulk information to a polynomial-size interface and
performing polynomial-time contraction solely at the interface level through boundary-map compositions and local
consistency propagation. The contraction manipulates the *topology* of the interface representation but cannot
perform *algebraic*, *metric*, *causal*, or *recursive* operations on the data encoded in the interface.

:::{prf:remark} Non-interference is satisfied by all five channel-specific witnesses

The $\lozenge$-supportedness property of {prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract` — requiring
$q \circ F^{\lozenge}_* = q$ for every $\lozenge'$-modal map $q$ with $\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$ —
is automatically satisfied by each of the five channel-specific witness definitions
({prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`,
{prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`, {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`,
{prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`, {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`).
In the linearized trace context (the factorization tree of
{prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification`), each step's effect on the global state is the
transported endomorphism $F^{\lozenge}_* = R^{\lozenge} \circ F^{\lozenge} \circ E^{\lozenge}$.
The channel-specific definitions enforce $\lozenge$-supportedness because each channel's
encode-compute-reconstruct cycle operates within a single modal workspace: the encoding
$E^{\lozenge}$ extracts $\lozenge$-relevant data from the global state, the computation
$F^{\lozenge}$ stays entirely within the $\lozenge$-workspace, and the reconstruction
$R^{\lozenge}$ restores only $\lozenge$-relevant data to the global state. Any
$\lozenge'$-modal observation $q$ (for $\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$) factors through the
$\lozenge'$-encoding and therefore cannot detect changes confined to the $\lozenge$-workspace.
The $\lozenge$-supportedness axiom thus codifies a property that each channel-specific definition
already enforces through its modal restriction and workspace structure — it elevates this shared
structural guarantee to the abstract schema where Channel Isolation
({prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification` Part I) can cite it directly.

:::{prf:remark} Why the $\partial$-modal restriction is computationally natural
:label: rem-boundary-restriction-natural

The restriction of $C_n^\partial$ to boundary-map compositions and local consistency propagation
(item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`) is not an ad hoc limitation — it
captures the essential computational character of known boundary/interface algorithms, and
examining where real algorithms *depart* from pure $\partial$-computation clarifies why the
restriction is genuinely tight:

1. **The FKT algorithm** for counting perfect matchings in planar graphs is instructive precisely
   because it is *not* a pure $\partial$-witness. The first phase — computing a Pfaffian
   orientation — is boundary-modal ($\partial$): each edge receives an orientation based on its
   local neighborhood in the planar dual graph, exploiting the planar *topology* through local
   operations. However, the second phase — evaluating the determinant of the resulting skew-symmetric
   adjacency matrix — is flat-modal ($\flat$): it is an *algebraic* operation (Gaussian elimination
   or LU decomposition) that acts on matrix entries without reference to the planar interface
   topology. FKT is therefore a mixed-modal ($\partial + \flat$) algorithm. The fact that even this
   textbook "topological" algorithm requires a non-$\partial$ algebraic step illustrates why pure
   $\partial$-witnesses are restrictive: real algorithms that exploit interface structure typically
   combine boundary operations with algebraic machinery that falls outside the $\partial$-modal
   fragment.

2. **Tree-decomposition algorithms** for bounded-treewidth graphs operate by *local message-passing*
   along the decomposition tree. At each bag of the decomposition, a table of partial solutions is
   computed from the tables of child bags — an operation that depends only on the $O(1)$-sized bag
   (the local neighborhood in the decomposition structure). The algorithm does not solve a global
   CSP; it propagates local information along the tree topology.

3. **Transfer-matrix methods** in statistical physics compute partition functions by multiplying
   transfer matrices along a spatial direction. Each matrix multiplication is a boundary-map
   composition: it takes the boundary state at one slice and produces the boundary state at the
   next slice. The method exploits the *quasi-one-dimensional topology* of the boundary.

The latter two examples (tree-decomposition, transfer-matrix) derive their power from the interface
having a *simple topological structure* (bounded-treewidth, quasi-1D) that permits efficient local
processing without algebraic side-channels — they are genuine pure $\partial$-witnesses. The FKT
example, by contrast, shows that even algorithms whose *structural* step is boundary-modal may
require flat-modal algebra to extract the final answer. This mixed-modal pattern is the norm rather
than the exception, which is precisely why the pure $\partial$-modal restriction captures a
genuinely limited fragment of polynomial-time computation: boundary-map compositions and
$O(1)$-local consistency propagation along the interface topology, with no algebraic, metric,
causal, or recursive side-operations.

3. **Composition rule.** If $\mathcal{T}_1,\dots,\mathcal{T}_r$ are profiles for composable families

   $$
   \mathcal{B}^{(1)},\dots,\mathcal{B}^{(r)},
   $$

   then a composition node may be formed with denotation

   $$
   \mathcal{B}^{(r)}\circ\cdots\circ\mathcal{B}^{(1)}.
   $$

4. **Finite product rule.** If $\mathcal{T}_1,\dots,\mathcal{T}_r$ are profiles, then a product node may be formed
   with denotation the coordinatewise product family, using the standard paired encoding of product families.
5. **Bounded iteration rule.** If $\mathcal{T}_0$ is a profile for an endomorphism family

   $$
   \mathcal{B}:\mathfrak{X}\Rightarrow\mathfrak{X}
   $$

   and $k:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ is a polynomial, then an iteration node may be formed with denotation

   $$
   \mathrm{Iter}_{k}(\mathcal{B})_n := \mathcal{B}_n^{\,k(n)}.
   $$

6. **Finite recursion rule.** If a family $\mathcal{R}$ is defined by a well-founded polynomially bounded recursion
   whose recursive calls are denoted by already-constructed subtrees and whose split/merge/administrative maps are
   presentation translators, then a recursion node may be formed.

The **leaf multiset** of $\mathcal{T}$ is the multiset of modality labels appearing at its leaves. A family may admit
many different modal profiles. No uniqueness is required or assumed.

We say that $\mathcal{A}$ **has modal profile** $\mathcal{T}$ if the denotation of $\mathcal{T}$ is extensionally
equal to $\mathcal{A}$ in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-extensional-equality-uniform-families`.

Let

denote the class of all uniform families admitting at least one pure witness of one of the five modalities.

The **saturated modal closure**

$$
\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle
$$

is the smallest class of uniform algorithm families, taken up to extensional equality, satisfying all of the
following.

1. **Pure inclusion.** Every family in

   belongs to

   $$
   \mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle.

3. **Closure under composition.** If $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ are composable members of the saturated class,

4. **Closure under finite products.** If $\mathcal{B}^{(1)},\dots,\mathcal{B}^{(r)}$ belong to the saturated class,
   then their coordinatewise product family belongs to the saturated class.
5. **Closure under bounded iteration.** If

   $$
   \mathcal{B}:\mathfrak{X}\Rightarrow\mathfrak{X}
   $$

   belongs to the saturated class and $k$ is polynomial, then

   $$
   \mathrm{Iter}_{k}(\mathcal{B})_n = \mathcal{B}_n^{\,k(n)}
   $$

   also belongs to the saturated class.
6. **Closure under finite well-founded recursion.** Suppose a family $\mathcal{R}$ is given by a recursive scheme

   $$
   \mathcal{R}_n(x)
   =
   H_n\!\Bigl(
   x,\

   where:
   - $b(n,x)\le q(n)$ for some polynomial $q$,
   - each size decreases strictly:

     m_i(n,x) < n,
     $$

   - each $g_{n,i}$ and $H_n$ is a presentation translator or is already denoted by a previously classified subtree,
   - the recursion tree has total size bounded by a polynomial in $n$.

   Then $\mathcal{R}$ belongs to the saturated class.

:::{prf:definition} The Five Algorithm Classes (Rigorous Modality Correspondence)
:label: def-five-algorithm-classes

For a uniform family $\mathcal{A}$, we write

$$
\mathcal{A} \triangleright \lozenge
$$

for the abstract $\lozenge$-modal route later formalized in
{prf:ref}`def-abstract-modal-factorization`. The concrete witness languages that are intended to realize those routes
are the pure witness schemas introduced above and characterized later by the universality ladder. The five pure
algorithm classes are then:

| Class | Name | Pure Witness | Exploited Resource | Examples | Detection |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| I | Climbers | $\mathcal{A} \triangleright \sharp$ | Metric descent, convexity, spectral gap | Gradient descent, local search, convex optimization | Node 7 ($\mathrm{LS}_\sigma$), Node 12 ($\mathrm{GC}_\nabla$) |
| II | Propagators | $\mathcal{A} \triangleright \int$ | Causal order, DAG structure, elimination | Dynamic programming, unit propagation, belief propagation | Tactic E6 (Well-Foundedness) |
| III | Alchemists | $\mathcal{A} \triangleright \flat$ | Algebraic symmetry, quotient, cancellation | Gaussian elimination, FFT, LLL | Tactic E4 (Integrality), E11 (Galois-Monodromy) |
| IV | Dividers | $\mathcal{A} \triangleright \ast$ | Self-similarity, recursion, scale factorization | Divide and conquer, mergesort, multigrid | Node 4 ($\mathrm{SC}_\lambda$) |
| V | Interference Engines | $\mathcal{A} \triangleright \partial$ | Interface compression, holographic cancellation | FKT/Matchgates, quantum algorithms | Tactic E8 (DPI), Node 6 ($\mathrm{Cap}_H$) |

Pure classes isolate a single modal core. Mixed algorithms are represented by modal profiles in
{prf:ref}`def-saturated-modal-closure-rigorous`, not by pretending that one modality alone carries the whole proof.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Obstruction Certificates
:label: def-obstruction-certificates

The following table records the current **tactic-level frontend obstruction certificates** attached to the five modal
channels. They should be read as coarse backend indicators feeding the reconstructed semantic obstruction theory of
Part V, not as the final sound-and-complete obstruction schemas themselves.

For each modality $\lozenge$, the notation $K_\lozenge^-$ names the corresponding obstruction channel, while the
displayed conditions record the current frontend realization used by the existing tactics:

| Modality | Certificate | Obstruction Condition |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| $\sharp$ (Metric) | $K_\sharp^-$ | No spectral gap; Łojasiewicz inequality fails; glassy landscape |
| $\int$ (Causal) | $K_\int^-$ | Frustrated loops; $\pi_1(\text{factor graph}) \neq 0$; no DAG structure |
| $\flat$ (Algebraic) | $K_\flat^-$ | Trivial automorphism group; no visible quotient symmetry; failure of current integrality/monodromy frontends |
| $\ast$ (Scaling) | $K_\ast^-$ | Supercritical scaling; boundary dominates in decomposition |
| $\partial$ (Holographic) | $K_\partial^-$ | Non-planar; no Pfaffian orientation; unbounded treewidth; failure of current interface-contraction frontends |

**Certificate Logic:** At theorem level, the coarse frontend package proves hardness only after the reconstructed
obstruction theory of Part V supplies:
1. soundness/completeness of the semantic obstruction calculi for the five modalities;
2. mixed-modal obstruction for minimal-rank solver trees;
3. compatibility of the current tactic-level frontend certificates with those semantic calculi.

Concretely, the intended route is that a frontend certificate package derives the reconstructed E13 package, which then
feeds the mixed-modal obstruction theorem:

$$
K_\sharp^- \wedge K_\int^- \wedge K_\flat^- \wedge K_\ast^- \wedge K_\partial^-
\implies
\mathsf{Sol}_{\mathrm{poly}}(\Pi)=\varnothing.
$$

This coarse contrapositive form is made precise later by
{prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`,
{prf:ref}`cor-e13-contrapositive-hardness-reconstructed`, and
{prf:ref}`prop-compatibility-with-current-tactics`.

:::{prf:remark} Why the encoding/decoding maps are restricted to presentation translators
:label: rem-why-translator-restriction

The translator restriction is essential. If one allowed arbitrary polynomial-time preprocessing and postprocessing in
the definition of pure modal factorization, then the factorization language would become vacuous: the preprocessor
could already solve the problem, leaving the modal core to do nothing.

By forcing the outer maps in a pure witness to be presentation translators, one isolates the genuine source of
algorithmic power in the middle modal stage. Mixed algorithms are then represented honestly by modal profiles and the
saturated closure rather than by hiding work in the encoding and decoding layers.
:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me make sure you understand what each of these classes is really doing. Think of each one as a different "trick"
for compressing your search space.

**Climbers** are algorithms that follow a gradient downhill. They work when your problem has a smooth landscape with a
clear direction toward the solution. Gradient descent is the prototype: at each step, you move in the direction that
decreases the objective function. The key insight is that you are exploiting *metric structure*, the ability to measure
"nearby" and "downhill."

**Propagators** exploit causal structure. Dynamic programming is the classic example: you solve subproblems in the right
order, so each answer is available when you need it. The trick is that information flows in one direction, like
dominoes falling. No cycles, no backtracking.

**Alchemists** exploit symmetry. If your problem has a large group acting on it, you can factor out that symmetry and
work in a smaller quotient space. Gaussian elimination works because linear algebra has a huge symmetry group. The FFT
works because the roots of unity form a cyclic group.

**Dividers** exploit self-similarity. If your problem looks the same at different scales, you can solve a smaller
version and piece together the answer. Mergesort does this: sorting $n$ elements reduces to sorting $n/2$ elements,
twice.

**Interference Engines** are the most exotic. They work when massive cancellations occur, like quantum algorithms where
exponentially many paths interfere to leave only the right answer. The FKT algorithm for counting perfect matchings in
planar graphs is the classical prototype.

:::{prf:remark} AIT Interpretation as a Derived Witness
:label: rem-ait-algorithm-classes

Entropy, volume, Kolmogorov complexity, and information-compression language may still be used as auxiliary invariants
attached to a pure witness or modal profile, but they do not define polynomial time. The primary definition is
{prf:ref}`def-internal-polytime-family-rigorous`, namely existence of a family cost certificate.

Each pure class nevertheless has a natural AIT shadow:

| Class | Modality | Derived AIT Mechanism | Typical Auxiliary Invariant |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| I (Climbers) | $\sharp$ | Decreasing potential | $K_{t+1} \le K_t - \Omega(1)$ per certified step |
| II (Propagators) | $\int$ | Shrinking unresolved dependency set | $K(x \mid \text{subproblems}) \ll K(x)$ |
| III (Alchemists) | $\flat$ | Algebraic quotient or cancellation | $K([x]_G) \le K(x) - \log|G| + O(1)$ |
| IV (Dividers) | $\ast$ | Well-founded recursion measure | Master-theorem style recurrence for the description size |
| V (Interference) | $\partial$ | Boundary-to-bulk compression | $K(\text{bulk}) \le K(\partial) + O(1)$ |

In Sieve instantiations, $K(\cdot)$ is evaluated on the encoded thin trace $T_{\mathrm{thin}}$ using the approximable
proxy $K_\epsilon$ with fixed resource bounds.

### Detailed Algorithm Class Specifications

We now provide concrete witness templates for each pure algorithm class. For readability, the shorthand
$\mathcal{A}\triangleright\lozenge$ from {prf:ref}`def-five-algorithm-classes` is used below; formally it means that,
after fixing admissible presentations of the relevant input and output families, $\mathcal{A}$ admits a pure
$\lozenge$-witness.

:::{prf:definition} Class I: Climbers (Sharp Modality)
:label: def-class-i-climbers

An algorithmic process $\mathcal{A}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}$ is **Class I (Climber)** if:

1. **Modal Factorization:** $\mathcal{A} \triangleright \sharp$ (factors through sharp modality)
2. **Height Functional:** There exists $\Phi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that:
   - $\Phi(\mathcal{A}(x)) < \Phi(x)$ for non-equilibrium states (strict descent)
   - $\Phi$ satisfies the **Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality**:

     $$\|\nabla \Phi(x)\| \geq c|\Phi(x) - \Phi^*|^{1-\theta}$$

     for some $c > 0$, $\theta \in (0,1)$, where $\Phi^*$ is the minimum value
3. **Spectral Gap:** The Hessian $\nabla^2\Phi$ at equilibria has spectral gap $\lambda > 0$

**Polynomial-Time Certificate:** $K_{\sharp}^+ = (\Phi, \theta, \lambda)$ where $\theta \geq 1/k$ for constant $k$ ensures convergence in $O(n^{k-1})$ steps.

**Examples:** Gradient descent on convex functions, simulated annealing with sufficient cooling, local search with Hamming distance.
:::

:::{prf:lemma} Sharp Modality Frontend Obstruction
:label: lem-sharp-obstruction

If the energy landscape $\Phi$ is **glassy** in the following sense:

1. **Cluster shattering:** The solution set partitions into $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters separated by
   Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$, with a $\Theta(n)$-fraction of variables frozen within each cluster.
2. **Vanishing spectral gap:** $\lambda_{\min}(\nabla^2 \Phi) \to 0$ on the hard subfamily.
3. **Łojasiewicz failure:** The Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality fails ($\theta \to 0$) near frozen-variable
   configurations.

then no pure $\sharp$-witness in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous` exists for the
problem family restricted to the hard subfamily. In particular, this blocks not only the Class I climber
template of {prf:ref}`def-class-i-climbers` but every pure $\sharp$-witness, regardless of the choice of
ranking function, transition map, or lifted state encoding.

**Obstruction Certificate:** $K_{\sharp}^- = (\text{glassy}, \lambda = 0, \theta \to 0)$

**Application:** Random 3-SAT near threshold has glassy landscape (Mézard-Parisi-Zecchina 2002,
Achlioptas-Coja-Oghlan 2008), supplying a sharp frontend blockage certificate.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The argument uses two ingredients: the **$\sharp$-purity constraint**, which limits the computational
vocabulary of $F_n^\sharp$ to metric-descent operations, and the **landscape properties**, which ensure
that metric-descent operations cannot navigate the shattered solution space. The combination is
non-circular: it derives the obstruction from the modal typing of the witness (a definitional constraint)
and proven landscape properties (ZFC theorems about random 3-SAT), without assuming hardness of any
computational problem.

**Step 1 ($\sharp$-purity constraint).**
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`, a pure $\sharp$-witness factors the algorithm as
$\mathcal{A}_n = R_n^\sharp \circ (F_n^\sharp)^{t_n} \circ E_n^\sharp$, where $E_n^\sharp$ and
$R_n^\sharp$ are presentation translators and $F_n^\sharp$ carries all nontrivial computational work.
The modality-specific certificate $\Pi_\sharp(F^\sharp)$ requires $F_n^\sharp$ to compute by
**certified descent in a polynomially bounded potential**: there exists a ranking function
$V_n^\sharp: Z_n^\sharp \to \{0, \ldots, q_\sharp(n)\}$ such that
$V_n^\sharp(F_n^\sharp(z)) \le V_n^\sharp(z) - 1$ for $z \notin S_n^\sharp$.

Crucially, item 6 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous` explicitly requires $F_n^\sharp$ to be
a $\sharp$-modal morphism in the ambient cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos: $F_n^\sharp$ factors as
$g_n \circ \eta^\sharp_n$ through the $\sharp$-unit. By the adjunction
$\Gamma \dashv \mathrm{coDisc}$ defining the $\sharp$ modality, this factorization means $F_n^\sharp$
accesses the **metric/potential structure** of the state space (point evaluations of $V$, local energy
differences, Hamming distances) but is **insensitive to shape ($\int$) structure**
(constraint-propagation paths, dependency-graph topology) and **insensitive to flat ($\flat$)
structure** (algebraic identities, symmetry-breaking information). This modal orthogonality follows
from the adjoint quadruple $\Pi \dashv \mathrm{Disc} \dashv \Gamma \dashv \mathrm{coDisc}$:
information accessible to the $\sharp$ modality is precisely the information that survives the
$\Gamma$-projection, which strips shape and flat structure.

Note: $F_n^\sharp$ reads the full state $z \in Z_n^\sharp$, but $\sharp$-purity constrains *how* $F$
uses $z$. A $\sharp$-modal function computes metric quantities from $z$ (energy, distances, rank) but
cannot extract $\int$-type information (constraint-graph connectivity, implication paths) or $\flat$-type
information (algebraic elimination sequences). This is the essential difference between a pure
$\sharp$-witness and a general polynomial-time algorithm: a general algorithm may combine $\sharp$, $\int$,
$\flat$, $\ast$, $\partial$ mechanisms, but a *pure* $\sharp$-witness is restricted to metric descent alone.

**Step 2 (Cluster navigation requires non-$\sharp$ information).**
On the shattered landscape, the solution set $S_n^\sharp$ partitions into $M = \exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters
$C_1, \ldots, C_M$ at pairwise Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$. Cluster membership is determined by the
**frozen-variable core**: within each cluster, a $\Theta(n)$-fraction of variables are forced to
specific values by the clause structure (Achlioptas-Coja-Oghlan 2008). The frozen core of each cluster
is defined by the implication structure of the constraint graph — which variables are forced by which
clauses, and how implications propagate through unit propagation chains. This is inherently $\int$-type
(shape) information: it is the connectivity and directed-path structure of the clause-variable dependency
graph.

Formally: let $\phi: \{0,1\}^n \to \{1, \ldots, M\}$ assign each configuration to its nearest solution
cluster (breaking ties arbitrarily). Computing $\phi(z)$ requires determining which frozen-variable
pattern $z$ is closest to, which in turn requires tracing implication chains in the constraint graph —
an $\int$-type computation. Since $\phi$ depends on the shape structure of the problem instance, it is
not computable by a $\sharp$-modal function.

**Step 3 (Metric uninformativeness on the shattered landscape).**
The $\sharp$-modal information available to $F_n^\sharp$ is insufficient for cluster navigation:

- **Vanishing spectral gap ($\lambda_{\min} \to 0$):** The spectral gap of the Glauber dynamics
  transition matrix on the hard subfamily tends to zero (Montanari-Semerjian 2006), giving mixing time
  $t_{\mathrm{mix}} = \exp(\Omega(n))$. Moreover, $k$-local energy statistics — the joint distribution
  of clause violation counts in any radius-$k$ neighborhood — are asymptotically identical across
  clusters for any fixed $k$ (Krzakała-Montanari-Rizzo-Zdeborová 2007). Consequently, for any
  polynomial $p(n)$, the metric structure in a $p(n)$-size neighborhood of a configuration $z$ carries
  $o(1)$ bits of mutual information with the cluster identity $\phi(z)$: any polynomial-time computable
  metric quantity (energy, local gradient, Hessian spectrum) has a distribution over random instances
  that is statistically indistinguishable across clusters, with total variation distance
  $\exp(-\Omega(n))$.

- **Łojasiewicz failure ($\theta \to 0$):** Near frozen-variable configurations, the gradient
  $\|\nabla\Phi\|$ vanishes while the energy gap to the nearest solution remains $\Theta(n)$. This means
  gradient-based descent directions — the primary $\sharp$-modal navigational tool — are uninformative:
  they point toward local energy improvements that do not correlate with progress toward any particular
  solution cluster.

- **Frozen-variable opacity:** The $\Theta(n)$ frozen variables that determine cluster identity are
  defined by the constraint-graph structure ($\int$-type). A $\sharp$-modal function cannot identify
  which variables are frozen or what their forced values should be, because this information is encoded
  in the implication graph, not in metric quantities. While individual variables do differ in their
  clause-participation counts, the *distributional* signature that distinguishes frozen from free
  variables — namely, the pattern of which high-degree variables are mutually constrained by implication
  chains — is an $\int$-type property invisible to the $\sharp$ modality. The metric data (energy,
  local gradients) at a given configuration are determined by aggregate clause-violation counts, which
  by the $k$-local indistinguishability above do not reveal frozen-variable identity.

**Step 4 (Direct $\sharp$-modal failure on the shattered landscape).**
Suppose toward contradiction that a pure $\sharp$-witness
$(V_n^\sharp, F_n^\sharp, S_n^\sharp, q_\sharp)$ exists on the hard subfamily.

By the concrete $\sharp$-modal restriction (item 6 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`;
see {prf:ref}`rem-modal-restrictions-finite-type`), the output $F_n^\sharp(z)$ is a deterministic
function of the **metric profile** of $z$: the $(D+2)$-tuple

$$
\mu_n^\sharp(z) \;\in\; \{0,\ldots,q_\sharp(n)\}^{D+2}
$$

where $D$ is the universal constant from item 6 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`. The
$D+2$ components consist of the rank value $V_n^\sharp(z)$, the energy $\Phi(z)$, and $D$ additional
metric/potential quantities (directional energy differences, local curvature estimates). Each component
takes values in $\{0, \ldots, q_\sharp(n)\}$, a set of polynomial size. Since $D$ is a **constant
independent of $n$**, the total number of distinct metric profiles is bounded by

$$
|\mathrm{Im}(\mu_n^\sharp)| \;\leq\; q_\sharp(n)^{D+2} \;=\; \mathrm{poly}(n),
$$

a polynomial in $n$. (Here the exponent $D+2$ is a fixed constant, so
$q_\sharp(n)^{D+2} = \mathrm{poly}(n)$ as claimed.)

Now apply the pigeonhole principle over the family of formula instances.

**Lower bound on $|H_n|$.**
Property 5 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat` states that every $F \in H_n$ has trivial
automorphism group: $\mathrm{Aut}(F) = \{\mathrm{id}\}$. Fix any $F_0 \in H_n$ and let
$\sigma$ range over all $n!$ permutations of the variable set $[n]$. For each $\sigma$, define
$F_0^\sigma$ to be the formula obtained by relabelling variable $i \mapsto \sigma(i)$ throughout
$F_0$. Because variable-permutation is a symmetry of the 3-SAT structure, all six properties of
{prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat` are preserved under relabelling. Properties 1–5 are
isomorphism-invariant properties of the formula's combinatorial and graph structure (shattering,
landscape geometry, frustration cores, expansion, and automorphism group), which are unchanged
by relabelling. Property 6 (Boolean fiber rigidity) is preserved because variable relabelling
is an algebraic automorphism of the polynomial ring, sending $V(F_0)$ bijectively to
$V(F_0^\sigma)$ and preserving the monodromy structure. Hence $F_0^\sigma \in H_n$ for every
$\sigma$. Since $\mathrm{Aut}(F_0) = \{\mathrm{id}\}$, distinct permutations $\sigma \neq \tau$
yield distinct formulas $F_0^\sigma \neq F_0^\tau$. Therefore

$$
|H_n| \;\geq\; n! \;=\; \exp(\Theta(n \log n)).
$$

**Pigeonhole collision.**
The entry states $e_F := E_n^\sharp(F)$ for $F \in H_n$ have metric profiles
$\mu_n^\sharp(e_F) \in \{0,\ldots,q_\sharp(n)\}^{D+2}$, drawn from a profile space of size at
most $q_\sharp(n)^{D+2} = \mathrm{poly}(n)$. By the pigeonhole principle there exists a profile
value $\mu^* \in \{0,\ldots,q_\sharp(n)\}^{D+2}$ and a collision set

$$
S \;:=\; \bigl\{F \in H_n : \mu_n^\sharp(e_F) = \mu^*\bigr\}
$$

with

$$
|S| \;\geq\; \frac{|H_n|}{q_\sharp(n)^{D+2}} \;\geq\; \frac{n!}{\mathrm{poly}(n)}
\;=\; \exp(\Theta(n \log n)).
$$

Since $F_n^\sharp$ is a function of the metric profile $\mu_n^\sharp(z)$ only — not of the
formula separately (see {prf:ref}`rem-modal-restrictions-finite-type` and item 6 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`) — every $F \in S$ causes the witness to follow the
*identical* computation trajectory from $e_F$, producing the same final state $z^* \in S_n^\sharp$
and the same candidate assignment $x^* := D_n^\sharp(z^*)$.

**Density bound via orbit decomposition.**
It remains to show that $x^*$ fails on some $F \in S$.

Define the **density-bounded** sub-family

$$
H_n^+
\;:=\;
\Bigl\{F \in H_n : \forall w \in \{0,\ldots,n\},\;
\bigl|\{y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F) : |y|=w\}\bigr|
\;\leq\;
\left(\tfrac{7}{8}\right)^{\alpha n/2}\binom{n}{w}\Bigr\}.
$$

*Density of $H_n^+$ in $H_n$.* For any fixed weight $w$, the expected number of weight-$w$
satisfying assignments of a uniformly random 3-CNF formula at ratio $\alpha$ is
$\binom{n}{w}\cdot(7/8)^{\alpha n}$. By Markov's inequality, the probability that this count
exceeds $(7/8)^{\alpha n/2}\binom{n}{w}$ is at most $(7/8)^{\alpha n/2} = \exp(-\Omega(n))$.
A union bound over $n+1$ weights gives

$$
\Pr\!\bigl[F \notin H_n^+\bigr] \;\leq\; (n+1)\exp(-\Omega(n)) \;=\; o(1).
$$

This Markov bound applies to the *unconditional* distribution of random 3-CNF formulas at
ratio $\alpha$. Since $\alpha < \alpha^* \approx 4.267$, a random formula at ratio $\alpha$ is
satisfiable with probability $1 - o(1)$ and satisfies each of properties 1–6 with probability
$1 - o(1)$, so $\Pr[F \in H_n] = 1 - o(1)$. The fraction of $H_n$ excluded from $H_n^+$ is

$$
\frac{|H_n \setminus H_n^+|}{|H_n|}
\;=\; \Pr\!\bigl[F \notin H_n^+ \;\big|\; F \in H_n\bigr]
\;=\; \frac{\Pr[F \in H_n \setminus H_n^+]}{\Pr[F \in H_n]}
\;\leq\; \frac{\Pr[F \notin H_n^+]}{\Pr[F \in H_n]}
\;\leq\; \frac{o(1)}{1-o(1)}
\;=\; o(1),
$$

where the first inequality uses $H_n \setminus H_n^+ \subseteq \{F \notin H_n^+\}$ (since
$H_n^+ \subseteq H_n$). Hence $|H_n^+| \geq (1-o(1))|H_n| \geq (1-o(1))n!$.

*Dense collision subset.* Recall $S = \{F \in H_n : \mu_n^\sharp(e_F) = \mu^*\}$ with
$|S| \geq |H_n|/\mathrm{poly}(n)$. Set $S^+ := S \cap H_n^+$. Then

$$
|S^+|
\;\geq\; |S| - |H_n \setminus H_n^+|
\;\geq\; \frac{|H_n|}{\mathrm{poly}(n)} - o(1)\cdot|H_n|
\;\geq\; \frac{|H_n|}{2\,\mathrm{poly}(n)}
$$

for all sufficiently large $n$. In particular $S^+$ is non-empty, and every $F \in S^+
\subseteq S$ causes the witness to output the same candidate assignment $x^*$.

*Orbit counting identity.* Since every $F \in H_n^+ \subseteq H_n$ has
$\mathrm{Aut}(F) = \{\mathrm{id}\}$ (property 5), and the defining density bound of $H_n^+$ is
permutation-invariant (variable relabelling preserves Hamming weight, so
$|\{x \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0^\sigma):|x|=w\}| = |\{y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0):|y|=w\}|$), the
set $H_n^+$ is closed under variable permutation, and the action of $S_n$ partitions $H_n^+$
into orbits of size exactly $n!$. For any orbit $T = \{F_0^\sigma : \sigma \in S_n\}
\subseteq H_n^+$ with base formula $F_0$, and any fixed $x^* \in \{0,1\}^n$ with $|x^*| = w$,
a direct count gives

$$
\bigl|\{F \in T : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}\bigr|
\;=\; w!\,(n-w)!\;\cdot\;\bigl|\{y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0) : |y| = w\}\bigr|.
$$

(Each solution $y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0)$ of weight $w$ contributes exactly $w!\,(n-w)!$ permutations
$\sigma$ for which $x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0^\sigma)$. The condition $x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0^\sigma)$
is equivalent to $(x^* \circ \sigma) \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0)$, i.e., $x^* \circ \sigma = y$, i.e.,
$x^*_{\sigma(j)} = y_j$ for all $j$. This forces $\sigma$ to map each $j$ with $y_j = 1$ to
some $i = \sigma(j)$ with $x^*_i = 1$, and each $j$ with $y_j = 0$ to some $i$ with $x^*_i = 0$.
Since $|y| = |x^*| = w$, these are bijections between equal-sized sets, giving $w!\,(n-w)!$
choices for $\sigma$; see also {prf:ref}`rem-sharp-pigeonhole-multi-formula`.)

Since $F_0 \in H_n^+$, the density bound holds by definition of $H_n^+$:

$$
\bigl|\{y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0) : |y| = w\}\bigr|
\;\leq\; \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^{\alpha n/2} \binom{n}{w}.
$$

Therefore

$$
\bigl|\{F \in T : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}\bigr|
\;\leq\; n!\;\cdot\;\left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^{\alpha n/2}
\;=\; |T| \cdot \exp(-\Omega(n)).
$$

Summing over all orbits that constitute $H_n^+$:

$$
\bigl|\{F \in H_n^+ : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}\bigr|
\;\leq\; \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^{\alpha n/2} \cdot |H_n^+|.
$$

Since $S^+ \subseteq H_n^+$ and $|H_n^+| \leq |H_n| \leq 2\,\mathrm{poly}(n)\cdot|S^+|$:

$$
\bigl|\{F \in S^+ : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}\bigr|
\;\leq\; \left(\frac{7}{8}\right)^{\alpha n/2} \cdot 2\,\mathrm{poly}(n) \cdot |S^+|
\;=\; \exp\!\bigl(-\Omega(n) + O(\log n)\bigr) \cdot |S^+|
\;<\; |S^+|
$$

for all sufficiently large $n$. Hence there exists $F \in S^+ \subseteq S$ with
$x^* \notin \mathrm{Sol}(F)$: the witness outputs a non-satisfying assignment on $F$.
This contradicts the assumed correctness of the pure $\sharp$-witness on $H_n$.

**Remark on the role of KMRZ.** The Krzakała-Montanari-Rizzo-Zdeborová (2007) result on
$k$-local energy indistinguishability across clusters (Step 3) provides *physical corroboration*
of the pigeonhole obstruction: it explains *why* the metric profiles of states near different
clusters are the same (they share the same local energy statistics). But the obstruction proof
does not depend on the KMRZ distributional result. The proof uses only: (i) the $\sharp$-modal determination (item 6 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`), which restricts $F_n^\sharp$ to a
$(D+2)$-dimensional metric profile with $D$ a universal constant; (ii) the polynomial cardinality
$q_\sharp(n)^{D+2} = \mathrm{poly}(n)$ of the profile space; (iii) automorphism triviality
(property 5 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`), which gives $|H_n| \geq n!$ and partitions
$H_n$ into orbits of size exactly $n!$; and (iv) a Markov-based density bound on the
auxiliary dense sub-family $H_n^+ \subseteq H_n$, which guarantees that within each orbit of
$H_n^+$, at most an $\exp(-\Omega(n))$ fraction of formulas are satisfied by any fixed
assignment $x^*$. The density bound is derived from the unconditional distribution at ratio
$\alpha < \alpha^*$ (where satisfiability probability is $1-o(1)$), not from a named property
of $H_n$ itself. These are respectively a definitional constraint, a counting fact, a structural
symmetry property of $H_n$, and a probabilistic regularity statement derived inline.

:::{prf:remark} Structure of the Step 4 argument
:label: rem-sharp-pigeonhole-multi-formula

The Step 4 argument has two levels that must be kept carefully distinct.

_Level 1 — the landscape (single formula, Steps 1–3)._ For a single 3-SAT formula $F$ near
the satisfiability threshold, the solution set $\mathrm{Sol}(F)$ shatters into
$\exp(\Theta(n))$ well-separated clusters (property 1 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`).
The vanishing spectral gap (property 2) and Łojasiewicz failure (property 3) certify that
gradient-based metric descent cannot navigate between clusters. These single-formula properties
are used to establish the certificate $K_\sharp^-$ in Step 5. They are _not_ directly used in
the pigeonhole.

_Level 2 — the family size (from automorphism triviality)._ Because every $F \in H_n$ has
$\mathrm{Aut}(F) = \{\mathrm{id}\}$ (property 5), the $n!$ variable-relabellings of any single
$F_0 \in H_n$ are all distinct and all remain in $H_n$, giving $|H_n| \geq n!$. Pigeonholing
over $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ metric profiles yields $|S| \geq |H_n|/\mathrm{poly}(n) \geq
n!/\mathrm{poly}(n)$.

_The orbit counting identity._ For any orbit $T = \{F_0^\sigma : \sigma \in S_n\}$ and any
fixed $x^*$ of weight $w$, the exact count is:

$$
\bigl|\{F \in T : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}\bigr|
= w!\,(n-w)! \cdot |\{y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0) : |y| = w\}|.
$$

_Proof of identity._ $x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0^\sigma)$ iff $\sigma^*(x^*) \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0)$,
where $\sigma^*(x^*)_j = x^*_{\sigma(j)}$. The string $\sigma^*(x^*)$ has weight $w$ (permutations
preserve Hamming weight) and equals $y$ iff $x^*_{\sigma(j)} = y_j$ for all $j$, i.e., $\sigma$
maps each position $j$ with $y_j = 1$ to a position $\sigma(j)$ with $x^*_{\sigma(j)} = 1$, and
each $j$ with $y_j = 0$ to a position with $x^*_{\sigma(j)} = 0$. For $|y| = w$, this requires
a bijection from the $w$ positions of $y$ equal to 1 into the $w$ positions of $x^*$ equal to 1
(and independently, from the $n-w$ positions of $y$ equal to $0$ into the $n-w$ positions of
$x^*$ equal to $0$), giving exactly $w!\,(n-w)!$ permutations $\sigma$. For $|y| \neq w$, none do.
Summing over solutions $y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_0)$ of weight $w$ gives the identity. $\square$

_Why $x^*$ fails: orbit density on $H_n^+$._ The dense sub-family $H_n^+\subseteq H_n$ satisfies
$|H_n^+| \geq (1-o(1))|H_n|$ (Markov bound, valid at $\alpha < \alpha^*$), and the dense
collision set $S^+ := S \cap H_n^+$ satisfies $|S^+| \geq |H_n|/(2\,\mathrm{poly}(n))$.
For any orbit $T\subseteq H_n^+$ and base formula $F_0\in H_n^+$, the density bound
$|\{y\in\mathrm{Sol}(F_0):|y|=w\}| \leq (7/8)^{\alpha n/2}\binom{n}{w}$ holds by definition of
$H_n^+$. Combined with the orbit counting identity:

$$
\bigl|\{F \in T : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}\bigr| \leq n! \cdot (7/8)^{\alpha n/2} = |T| \cdot \exp(-\Omega(n)).
$$

Summing over all orbits in $H_n^+$:
$|\{F \in H_n^+ : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}| \leq (7/8)^{\alpha n/2} \cdot |H_n^+|$.
Since $S^+ \subseteq H_n^+$ and $|H_n^+| \leq 2\,\mathrm{poly}(n) \cdot |S^+|$:

$$
|\{F \in S^+ : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}| \leq (7/8)^{\alpha n/2} \cdot 2\,\mathrm{poly}(n) \cdot |S^+| \;<\; |S^+|.
$$

_Why $n!$ is the critical ingredient._ This argument works entirely within $H_n$, never
comparing against the full 3-CNF formula universe. The bound $|H_n| \leq \mathrm{poly}(n) \cdot
|S|$ uses only the pigeonhole over $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ profiles. The exponential density penalty
$(7/8)^{\alpha n/2} = \exp(-\Omega(n))$ overwhelms the polynomial $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ correction,
giving a net factor $\exp(-\Omega(n)) \to 0$. The $n!$ lower bound on orbit sizes (from
automorphism triviality) is what ensures the orbit decomposition of $H_n$ is valid with all
orbits of size $n!$; it does not need to dominate any other exponential quantity.

_Contrast with the $\int$-obstruction._ The $\int$-obstruction
({prf:ref}`lem-causal-arbitrary-poset-transfer`) is a _single-formula_ argument: it shows that
for any one formula in $H_n$, a pure $\int$-witness cannot commit to all variable values without
observing cycle-closing clauses. The $\sharp$-obstruction proved here is complementary: it is a
_family-level_ argument showing that no poly-profile pure $\sharp$-witness can output a correct
assignment for every formula in $H_n$.
:::

**Step 5 (Landscape certificate).**
The three glassy signatures supply the concrete certificate
$K_{\sharp}^- = (\text{glassy}, \lambda = 0, \theta \to 0)$:
(i) automorphism triviality (property 5) gives $|H_n| \geq n! = \exp(\Theta(n \log n))$
and partitions $H_n$ into orbits of size $n!$; the pigeonhole argument in Step 4 combines this
with the polynomial cardinality $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ of the metric-profile space to force a collision
set $S \subseteq H_n$ with $|S| \geq |H_n|/\mathrm{poly}(n)$, all receiving the same output $x^*$;
and the Markov-based solution density bound on the auxiliary sub-family $H_n^+$ guarantees that
within each orbit of $H_n^+$ at most $\exp(-\Omega(n))$ fraction of formulas are satisfied by
$x^*$, giving $|\{F \in S^+ : x^* \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)\}| < |S^+|$;
(ii) vanishing spectral gap and $k$-local indistinguishability (Krzakała et al. 2007) provide
*physical corroboration*: they explain why the metric profiles of states near different clusters
are the same (local energy statistics are asymptotically identical), supporting the counting
argument in Step 4 with distributional evidence;
(iii) Łojasiewicz failure ensures that gradient-based descent — the canonical $\sharp$-modal mechanism —
provides no cluster-routing signal, reinforcing the cluster-blindness even for gradient-following
strategies.

**Conclusion.** The $\sharp$-purity constraint restricts $F_n^\sharp$ to metric-descent computation: $F$
reads the full state $z$ but can only extract and act on metric/potential information (rank, energy,
distances), not constraint-graph structure ($\int$-type) or algebraic identities ($\flat$-type). The
shattered landscape ensures that metric information alone cannot navigate to the correct solution cluster,
because cluster identity is determined by the frozen-variable core — an $\int$-type object invisible to
the $\sharp$ modality. This obstruction holds regardless of the choice of ranking function $V$, transition
map $F$, lifted state encoding $E^\sharp$, or polynomial degree of $q_\sharp$. Hence no pure
$\sharp$-witness exists on the hard subfamily.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Physical naturality of constant-dimensional metric profiles
:label: rem-constant-D-metric-profile

The requirement that the metric profile $\mu_n^\sharp(z)$ have a **constant** number $D+2$ of
components (independent of $n$) is not an artificial restriction — it reflects the operational
reality of classical optimization algorithms:

1. **Standard metric-descent algorithms use $O(1)$ quantities per step.** Gradient descent
   evaluates the current energy and a proposed-step energy (2 quantities). Simulated annealing
   adds a temperature and an acceptance probability ($\leq 4$ quantities). WalkSAT evaluates the
   current energy and the make/break counts of a randomly chosen variable ($\leq 3$ quantities).
   In each case, the transition rule is determined by a fixed finite number of metric observations,
   independent of the problem size $n$.

2. **An algorithm that reads $\omega(1)$ metric quantities per step is performing a non-local
   scan.** If the transition map requires evaluating the energy at $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ neighboring
   configurations (i.e., $D$ growing with $n$), it is effectively surveying the constraint structure
   by aggregating information across a macroscopic fraction of the state space. Such aggregation
   accesses the *shape* of the energy landscape (which directions are connected to improving moves,
   how constraints propagate) — information that properly belongs to the $\int$ modality. An algorithm
   with $D = D(n) \to \infty$ should therefore be classified as $\int$-modal (reading constraint
   structure) or $\flat$-modal (reading algebraic structure), not $\sharp$-modal.

The constant-$D$ restriction thus delineates the precise boundary between local metric operations
($\sharp$-modal) and global structural operations ($\int$/$\flat$-modal), ensuring that the modal
classification faithfully captures the computational mechanism of each algorithm class.

:::{prf:definition} Class II: Propagators (Shape Modality)
:label: def-class-ii-propagators

An algorithmic process $\mathcal{A}: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{X}$ is **Class II (Propagator)** if:

1. **Modal Factorization:** $\mathcal{A} \triangleright \int$ (factors through shape modality)
2. **DAG Structure:** The dependency graph $G = (V, E)$ is a directed acyclic graph with:
   - $\mathrm{depth}(G) \leq p(n)$ for polynomial $p$
   - $\mathrm{deg}^{-}(v) \leq k$ for constant $k$ (bounded in-degree)
3. **Topological Order:** The shape $\int \mathcal{X}$ has trivial fundamental group: $\pi_1(\int \mathcal{X}) = 0$

**Polynomial-Time Certificate:** $K_{\int}^+ = (G, d, k)$ where $d = \mathrm{depth}(G)$ and $k = \max \mathrm{deg}^{-}$ give time complexity $O(|V| \cdot k) = O(d \cdot w \cdot k)$ for width $w$.

**Examples:** Dynamic programming, belief propagation on trees, unit propagation for Horn-SAT.
:::

:::{prf:lemma} Shape Modality Frontend Obstruction (Frustrated Loops)
:label: lem-shape-obstruction

If the dependency structure contains **frustrated loops**—cycles where constraints cannot be simultaneously
satisfied—then the standard propagation/elimination witness language of {prf:ref}`def-class-ii-propagators` is
blocked, yielding a valid frontend obstruction for the $\int$-channel.

Formally: If $\pi_1(\int \mathcal{X}) \neq 0$ (non-trivial fundamental group), then propagation around cycles produces inconsistencies requiring exponential backtracking.

**Obstruction Certificate:** $K_{\int}^- = (\pi_1 \neq 0, \text{cycles})$

**Application:** Random 3-SAT has frustrated loops (conflicting clause cycles), supplying an $\int$-frontend blockage.
Horn-SAT has $\pi_1 = 0$ (acyclic implications), enabling the standard propagator witness template. The full
sound-and-complete $\int$-obstruction theorem is deferred to Part V.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
A pure $\int$-witness ({prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`) requires a well-founded dependency
poset $(P_n, \prec_n)$ of polynomial size and height, with local update maps $U_{n,i}$ such that the
update at site $i$ depends only on predecessors $j \prec_n i$.

Frustrated cycles create circular dependencies: the correct value at site $i$ depends on the value
at site $j$ and vice versa. Any well-founded poset must linearize these dependencies, forcing one
site to be updated before the other. But in a frustrated cycle, updating $i$ before $j$ produces an
incorrect intermediate state at $j$'s position, which cannot be corrected by $j$'s local update
(since $j$'s update sees only predecessors, not successors). The frustration ensures that no linear
ordering of updates can simultaneously satisfy all dependency constraints within the poset structure
required by a pure $\int$-witness.

:::{prf:definition} Propagator Tube Witness (Geodesic Progress Certificate)
:label: def-propagator-tube-witness

This definition packages a common “thin-solution-manifold” situation in the **Propagator / shape** regime into an
explicit certificate that yields a **linear-in-depth** bound for population-based propagators (including Fractal Gas
instantiations) on tree/graph growth problems.

**Setup (rooted transition system).**
Let $(X,x_0,\mathsf{Next},\mathsf{Goal})$ be a rooted transition system, where $\mathsf{Next}(x)\subseteq X$ is finite
and $\mathsf{Goal}\subseteq X$ is the goal set. Define the depth

$$
\mathrm{depth}(x):=\min\{k:\exists x_1,\dots,x_k\ \text{s.t.}\ x_1\in\mathsf{Next}(x_0),\ x_{i+1}\in\mathsf{Next}(x_i),\ x_k=x\},
$$
and the optimal goal depth $d_\star:=\min_{x\in\mathsf{Goal}}\mathrm{depth}(x)$.

**Definition (tube witness).**
Fix a population-based Propagator update rule (one “outer iteration”) consisting of:
1. a one-step proposal/transition mechanism, and
2. a selection/resampling mechanism that can preserve promising branches.

A **Propagator tube witness** is a tuple $(\mathcal{T},V,\delta,p)$ where $\mathcal{T}\subseteq X$ is a “tube”,
$V:X\to\mathbb{R}$ is a progress functional, and $\delta,p>0$ are constants such that:
1. (**Tube**) $x_0\in\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}\cap\mathsf{Goal}\neq\varnothing$.
2. (**Forward connectivity**) For every $x\in\mathcal{T}$ with $\mathrm{depth}(x)<d_\star$ there exists
   $y\in\mathsf{Next}(x)\cap\mathcal{T}$ with $\mathrm{depth}(y)=\mathrm{depth}(x)+1$.
3. (**Strict progress**) For any such tube edge $x\to y$, $V(y)\ge V(x)+\delta$.
4. (**Tube-following probability**) Conditioned on any walker being at any $x\in\mathcal{T}$ with
   $\mathrm{depth}(x)<d_\star$, the proposal mechanism proposes at least one tube successor as in (2) with probability
   $\ge p$.
5. (**Non-extinction on the tube**) The selection/resampling step preserves at least one tube walker until
   $\mathsf{Goal}$ is reached.

**Interpretation:** This is an explicit “geodesic tube” regularity certificate inside Class II (Propagators): the
effective branching factor on $\mathcal{T}$ is 1 (a wavefront advances down a well-founded chain), even if the ambient
branching factor $b=\sup_x|\mathsf{Next}(x)|$ is large.

:::{prf:theorem} [MT-GeodesicTunneling] The Geodesic Tunneling of Fractal Trees
:label: mt:geodesic-tunneling-fractal-trees

**Status:** Conditional (solver-specific envelope inside Class II; the singular-case fallback uses {prf:ref}`mt:levin-search`).

**Statement (Propagator wavefront bound).**
Assume the instance is Regular in the **Propagator / shape** sense (Definition {prf:ref}`def-class-ii-propagators`) and
admits a Propagator tube witness $(\mathcal{T},V,\delta,p)$ (Definition {prf:ref}`def-propagator-tube-witness`). Then the
expected number of outer iterations for a population-based Propagator to reach $\mathsf{Goal}$ satisfies

$$
\mathbb{E}[T_{\mathrm{hit}}]\ \le\ d_\star/p,
$$
independent of the ambient branching factor $b$.

**Statement (singular regime fallback).**
If all five modalities are blocked (Definition {prf:ref}`def-obstruction-certificates`), no polynomial-time progress
certificate exists in the worst case. In that regime, guarantees reduce to the chosen prior/schedule; an explicit
Levin-equivalent instantiation exists by Metatheorem {prf:ref}`mt:levin-search`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Let $Z_t$ be the maximum depth among walkers in the tube $\mathcal{T}$ after iteration $t$. By the non-extinction
assumption in Definition {prf:ref}`def-propagator-tube-witness`, there is always at least one tube walker at depth $Z_t$
until $d_\star$ is reached.

Conditioned on being at any $x\in\mathcal{T}$ with $\mathrm{depth}(x)<d_\star$, the tube-following probability yields

$$
\mathbb{P}(Z_{t+1}=Z_t+1\mid Z_t<d_\star)\ge p.
$$
Therefore the waiting time to advance the wavefront by one depth level is stochastically dominated by a geometric
random variable with mean $1/p$. By linearity of expectation over the $d_\star$ required advances,
$\mathbb{E}[T_{\mathrm{hit}}]\le d_\star/p$.

The bound is independent of $b$ because the tube witness asserts screening onto $\mathcal{T}$: only a
constant-probability “correct successor” event is needed per depth increment.

In the singular regime (all obstruction certificates), the absence of any separating modal structure prevents such a
tube progress certificate in the worst case; the Levin-equivalent fallback is exactly Metatheorem {prf:ref}`mt:levin-search`.

2. **Symmetry Group:** There exists a non-trivial group $G$ acting on $\mathcal{X}$ such that:

   - $|G| = \Omega(2^n / \mathrm{poly}(n))$ (exponential symmetry reduction)
   - Solutions lift from quotient: $\mathcal{X}/G \to \mathcal{X}$
3. **Quotient Compression:** $|\mathcal{X}/G| = \mathrm{poly}(n)$

**Polynomial-Time Certificate:** $K_{\flat}^+ = (G, |G|, \mathcal{X}/G)$ gives compression factor $|G|$ and quotient size $|\mathcal{X}/G|$.

If the automorphism group is trivial:

equals the full space: $\mathcal{X}/G = \mathcal{X}$. No such symmetry compression occurs.

**Application:** Random instances have trivial automorphism with high probability, supplying a flat frontend blockage.
XORSAT has large kernel group $|G| = 2^{n-\mathrm{rank}(A)}$, enabling this concrete symmetry-based frontend route. The
full strengthened $\flat$-obstruction theorem of Part V must additionally rule out non-symmetry algebraic sketches.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Pure $\flat$-witness structure]:**
A pure $\flat$-witness ({prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`) requires:
- an effective finite-sorted algebraic signature $\Sigma$ fixed independently of $n$,
- finite $\Sigma$-structures $A_n^\flat$, $B_n^\flat$ with cardinalities bounded
  by a polynomial $q_\flat(n)$,
- a polynomial-time algebraic elimination map $e_n^\flat : A_n^\flat \to B_n^\flat$ built from
  certified $\Sigma$-primitives (quotienting, linear elimination, rank/determinant, Fourier
  transforms, polynomial-identity cancellation, monodromy-based reductions),
- and the correctness identity $\mathcal{A}_n = d_n^\flat \circ e_n^\flat \circ s_n^\flat$.

We show that random 3-SAT at the satisfiability threshold admits no such witness, addressing
both the visible-symmetry route and the broader algebraic sketch routes in turn.

**Step 2. [Visible symmetry blockage — trivial automorphism]:**
The simplest $\flat$-route is quotient compression via the automorphism group
$G_\Phi := \mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{X}, \Phi)$. For random 3-SAT at ratio
$\alpha \approx 4.267$, each variable participates in $\Theta(1)$ clauses with distinct
neighborhoods, so $G_\Phi = \{e\}$ for every $F \in H_n$ deterministically
(property 5 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`). Since the quotient equals the full space
$\mathcal{X}/G = \mathcal{X}$, no compression via visible symmetry quotienting occurs.

**Step 3. [Broader algebraic sketch blockage — frozen variables and monodromy rigidity]:**
The strengthened $\flat$-class ({prf:ref}`thm-flat-universality`) encompasses all polynomial-size
algebraic sketches, not merely symmetry quotients. We must therefore show that *no* admissible
algebraic elimination map $e_n^\flat$ over *any* effective ring or field structure can keep
intermediate structure cardinalities polynomial. The obstruction has two independent sources:

**(3a) Frozen-variable algebraic rigidity.** The solution space of random 3-SAT in the hard
subfamily ({prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`) exhibits propagation rigidity: an
$\Omega(n)$-sized set of frozen variables whose values are determined by membership in a
solution cluster (property 1, solution-space shattering). Any algebraic elimination map
$e_n^\flat$ must have its kernel/image controlled by the algebraic structure of the solution
variety. The frozen coordinates constitute $\Omega(n)$ algebraically independent generators
that cannot be eliminated while keeping intermediate structures polynomially bounded in
cardinality — eliminating any frozen variable propagates constraints through the
$\Theta(n)$-sized frustration cores (property 3), forcing $2^{\Omega(n)}$ intermediate states
in any elimination schedule. This blocks quotient, linear, rank/determinant, Fourier, and
polynomial-identity sketch routes.

**(3b) Boolean fiber rigidity makes the monodromy sketch vacuous.** The algebraic variety
$V(F) = \{z \in \mathbb{C}^n : \text{clause polynomials and } z_j^2 - z_j = 0\}$ coincides
with the Boolean solution set $\mathrm{Sol}(F) \subset \{0,1\}^n$ — no additional complex
solutions exist (property 6 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`). The covering space over the
clause-weight parameter space $\Lambda$ has discrete Boolean fibers: as $\lambda$ traces a loop
in $\Lambda \setminus \Delta$, each Boolean assignment either satisfies the formula or not,
deterministically. The monodromy is therefore trivial: $\mathrm{Mon} = \{\mathrm{id}\}$.

With trivial monodromy, the $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{mono}}$ sub-channel — which requires a
non-trivial solvable group acting on the solution space via monodromy structure — has nothing
to act on. The solvable-monodromy paradigm is **structurally inapplicable** to Boolean
satisfiability. Any algebraic extraction technique that does not leverage monodromy structure
falls into one of the other five signature families ($\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{quot}}$,
$\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{lin}}$, $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{rank}}$,
$\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{fourier}}$, $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{polyid}}$), each independently
blocked by its own no-sketch theorem. This specifically blocks the monodromy sketch route
by vacuity rather than by non-solvability.

**Step 4. [Conclusion]:**
Combining Steps 2 and 3: the visible-symmetry route is blocked by automorphism triviality,
and every broader algebraic sketch route is blocked either by frozen-variable rigidity (3a)
or by Boolean fiber rigidity (3b). Therefore no choice of $\Sigma$, $A_n^\flat$, $B_n^\flat$
satisfies the polynomial bound $|A_n^\flat|, |B_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n)$, and no pure
$\flat$-witness exists.

The full formal argument — covering all six signature families of the admissible primitive
basis and establishing translator stability under re-encodings — is carried out in
{prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-algebraic-blockage-strengthened`.

:::{prf:lemma} Scaling Modality Frontend Obstruction (Supercritical)
:label: lem-scaling-obstruction

If the problem is **supercritical**—decomposition creates more work than it saves—then the standard divide-and-conquer
template of {prf:ref}`def-class-iv-dividers` is blocked, yielding a valid frontend obstruction for the $\ast$-channel.

Formally: If for any balanced partition $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{X}_1 \sqcup \mathcal{X}_2$:

$$|\operatorname{boundary}(\mathcal{X}_1, \mathcal{X}_2)| = \Omega(|\mathcal{X}|)$$

then recombination cost dominates: $f(n) = \Omega(T(n))$, making recursion futile.

**Obstruction Certificate:** $K_{\ast}^- = (\text{supercritical}, |\partial| = \Omega(n))$

**Application:** Random 3-SAT has $\Theta(n)$ boundary clauses for any cut, supplying an $\ast$-frontend blockage. The
full sound-and-complete $\ast$-obstruction theorem is deferred to Part V.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
A pure $\ast$-witness ({prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`) requires:
(i) a splitting map producing subinstances of strictly smaller size measure $\mu$,
(ii) a polynomial-time merge map combining subanswers, and
(iii) a polynomial bound $q_\ast(n)$ on the total recursion-tree size (number of nodes and total local
work across all nodes).

The $\ast$-specific mechanism of failure is the **violation of compositional independence** — the
structural requirement that sub-solutions be independently valid and combinable by the merge map
cannot be satisfied, because crossing constraints at every split force the merge to operate on
the *entire* instance rather than on a local interface.

**Step 1. [Crossing constraints couple the subproblems]:**
Consider any balanced split $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{X}_1 \sqcup \mathcal{X}_2$ of a random 3-SAT
instance. The expansion property guarantees $|\operatorname{boundary}(\mathcal{X}_1, \mathcal{X}_2)|
= \Theta(n)$ crossing clauses, each involving variables from *both* $\mathcal{X}_1$ and
$\mathcal{X}_2$. The subanswers for $\mathcal{X}_1$ and $\mathcal{X}_2$ are therefore not
independently correct — an assignment satisfying all clauses internal to $\mathcal{X}_1$ may violate
crossing clauses once combined with the assignment for $\mathcal{X}_2$.

**Step 1b. [Universal coverage of splitting strategies]:**
The definition of a pure $\ast$-witness ({prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`) permits *any*
splitting map that produces subinstances of strictly smaller size measure — not only balanced binary
variable-partition splits. We must verify that the structural obstruction holds for all such
strategies. The cases are exhaustive:

**(a) Balanced splits with both parts of size $\Omega(n)$:** This is the setting of the remaining
steps (Steps 2--4). The expansion property guarantees $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints at every
balanced cut, and the merge-propagation cascade forces $\Omega(n)$ non-trivial work per recursion
level. This case is treated in full below.

**(b) Highly unbalanced splits (one part of size $o(n)$):** Suppose the splitting map produces one
subinstance of size $n - o(n)$ and one of size $o(n)$. The "large" subinstance retains essentially
the full constraint structure: only $o(n)$ variables are separated out, and by the expansion
property the large part still contains $\Theta(n)$ unsolved constraints.

*Stability of hard-regime structure under $o(n)$ removal.* We verify that removing (or conditioning
on) $o(n)$ variables preserves the properties required by Steps 2--4:

- *Clause-density preservation:* Each variable appears in $\Theta(1)$ clauses, so removing $o(n)$
  variables eliminates at most $o(n) \cdot O(1) = o(n)$ clauses. The residual formula has
  $m - o(n)$ clauses on $n - o(n)$ variables, and the clause-to-variable ratio converges to the
  threshold $\alpha$ as $n \to \infty$.
- *Cluster structure stability:* By the results of Achlioptas--Coja-Oghlan (2008), the shattering
  of the solution space into $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters is robust to the removal of $o(n)$
  variables. Conditioning on $o(n)$ variables can collapse some clusters but preserves
  $\exp(\Theta(n - o(n))) = \exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters in the residual instance.
- *Expansion preservation:* Removing $o(n)$ vertices from an $n$-vertex expander leaves an
  $(n - o(n))$-vertex graph with the same expansion constant up to lower-order corrections
  (the edge expansion $h(G) \geq c$ implies $h(G') \geq c - o(1)$ for the subgraph $G'$ induced
  by the remaining vertices).

With these properties intact, the recursion on the large
part reduces to a near-sequential computation: the recursion tree degenerates into a path of
$n - o(n)$ steps, each processing $O(1)$ new constraints from the small subinstances. The total
recursion-tree size is dominated by this path length, which is $\Omega(n)$. Crucially, each node on
this path still operates on an instance with $\Theta(n)$ unsolved constraints, because only $o(n)$
constraints are resolved by the small subinstance at each step. By the correctness condition, the
recursive calls on the large subinstances must still produce complete satisfying assignments, and
the solution-space shattering ($\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters with Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$) ensures
that each such call faces the full hardness of the instance. This degenerate recursion tree does not
decompose the problem — it merely serializes it.

**(c) Non-variable-partition splits in the lifted state space:** The splitting map operates on the
lifted state $Z_n^\ast$, not on the variable set directly. However, by the correctness identity
$A_n = R_n^\ast \circ F_{\rho(n)}^\ast \circ E_n^\ast$, the final output must be a correct
satisfying assignment. Therefore, the information content of the subinstances — regardless of their
encoding — must collectively determine a satisfying assignment. By a data-processing argument: any
correct splitting/merge scheme must, at the merge step, reconcile the constraint structure of the
original formula. The expansion property is a property of the constraint structure itself, not of any
particular encoding. Therefore, any merge that produces a correct output must effectively resolve
$\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints, regardless of how the subinstances are encoded. The lifted-state
encoding $E_n^\ast$ can reformat the problem but cannot eliminate the constraint coupling that
expansion creates.

**(d) Multi-way splits with polynomial fan-out:** When the splitting map produces
$b(z) \leq q_\ast(n)$ subinstances, the total number of crossing constraints summed over all
inter-part boundaries is still $\Omega(n)$ by the expansion property: each partition into $k$ parts,
however fine, has at least $c' \cdot n$ clauses touching multiple parts when the number of parts is
bounded by $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ (this follows because the edge expansion of the random constraint
graph is $\Theta(1)$, so any partition into $k = \operatorname{poly}(n)$ parts has total boundary
size $\Omega(n)$). Therefore the aggregate merge cost per level remains $\Omega(n)$, and the
structural argument of Step 4 applies without modification.

Since cases (a)--(d) are exhaustive over the strategies permitted by
{prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`, the obstruction established in Steps 2--4 below applies
universally.

**Step 2. [Merge propagation reaches $\Omega(n)$ variables via expansion]:**
The merge map $\mathrm{merge}_n$ receives partial assignments $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ for the two
subinstances and must produce a globally consistent assignment. To reconcile the $\Theta(n)$
crossing constraints, the merge must modify some variable assignments. Define the *repair graph*
$R$: its vertices are variables and its edges connect any two variables that co-occur in a clause
with a variable whose assignment was flipped during reconciliation. For random 3-SAT at the
critical clause-to-variable ratio, the constraint hypergraph is an expander: every set of $k$
variables with $k \leq \delta n$ (for a constant $\delta > 0$) appears in at least $c \cdot k$
clauses involving variables outside the set. Consequently, flipping any variable to satisfy a
crossing clause can violate an internal clause in $\mathcal{X}_1$ or $\mathcal{X}_2$, requiring a
further flip, which by expansion propagates through the constraint graph until $\Omega(n)$ variables
have been touched. In other words, any repair process — sequential, parallel, or algebraic — that
reconciles the crossing constraints must read and potentially modify $\Omega(n)$ variables from
*both* partitions, not merely the variables appearing in the crossing clauses themselves.

We make this propagation rigorous using the rigid cluster structure of the hard subfamily $H_n$.
By property 2 (glassy landscape) of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`, every $F \in H_n$
deterministically exhibits *propagation rigidity* (freezing): an $\Omega(n)$-sized subset of
variables are *frozen*
— their values are uniquely determined by cluster membership. Suppose the merge map modifies a
frozen variable $x_i$ to satisfy a crossing clause. Because $x_i$'s value is forced within its
cluster, this modification ejects the assignment from the current solution cluster and violates
internal clauses constraining $x_i$. Define the cascade set $C_0 = \{x_i\}$ and
$C_{t+1} = C_t \cup \{y : y \text{ appears in a clause violated by the modification of some }
z \in C_t\}$. By the expander mixing lemma for the random clause–variable bipartite graph, every
set $S$ of at most $\delta n$ variables neighbours at least $c|S|$ clauses involving variables
outside $S$ (for constants $\delta, c > 0$ depending on $\alpha$). Therefore
$|C_{t+1}| \geq (1+c)\,|C_t|$ whenever $|C_t| \leq \delta n$, giving
$|C_t| \geq (1+c)^t$, so the cascade reaches $\Omega(n)$ variables after $t = O(\log n)$ steps.
Since frozen variables comprise an $\Omega(n)$-sized set deterministically for every $F \in H_n$
(property 2 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`), at least one frozen variable
is modified with constant probability over balanced splits, triggering this cascade.

**Step 3. [Non-shrinking effective subproblems violate the $\ast$-witness structure]:**
The critical obstruction is not the per-level merge cost (which is $\Omega(n)$ and polynomial) but
the failure of the **effective subproblem size to shrink across recursion levels**. In a valid
$\ast$-witness, splitting a size-$n$ instance produces subinstances of size measure
$\mu < n$, and the recursion terminates because the size measure strictly decreases. Here, the
$\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints at each split ensure that the merge at each level must access
$\Omega(n)$ variables from the *original* instance.

Formally: let $S(\ell)$ denote the number of variables whose assignments are not yet finalized
after level-$\ell$ merges. At level 0, $S(0) = n$. After the level-1 merges, the $\Theta(n)$
crossing constraints force modifications to $\Omega(n)$ variables (by the expansion argument of
Step 2), so $S(1) = \Omega(n)$. At each subsequent level $\ell$, the merge must reconcile the
$\Omega(n)$ modified variables with the crossing constraints at that level, again touching
$\Omega(n)$ variables: $S(\ell) = \Omega(n)$ for all $\ell$. Since $S(\ell)$ does not decay, the
recursion makes no progress toward independently solvable subproblems. Each of the $\Theta(\log n)$
levels contributes $\Omega(n)$ non-trivial merge work, and the $\Omega(n)$ variables modified at
each level invalidate previously computed sub-solutions, requiring re-computation at lower levels.

Because the fraction of invalidated assignments does not decay (modifications propagate to a
constant fraction of variables by expansion), each level-$\ell$ merge must redo $\Omega(n)$ work
for each of the preceding levels whose results were invalidated. The effective work per level
therefore grows as $\Omega(n \cdot \ell)$, and the total work across all levels is at least
$\sum_{\ell=1}^{\Theta(\log n)} \Omega(n \cdot \ell) = \Omega(n \cdot (\log n)^2)$.

This $\Omega(n (\log n)^2)$ bound is polynomial and does not by itself violate the polynomial
total-work bound $q_\ast(n)$ of item 6. It serves as a *preliminary indicator* that the recursion
fails to decompose the problem; the actual impossibility is structural and is established in Step 4
below via the $\ast$-modal restriction (item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`).

**Step 4. [The fundamental structural obstruction — modal-purity violation]:**
The quantitative blowup of Step 3, while significant, understates the true obstruction, which is
*structural* rather than merely quantitative: the merge map in a pure $\ast$-witness **cannot
represent** the computation required for correctness. The obstruction is not that the merge
"takes too long" but that the merge, restricted to $\ast$-modal operations, is structurally
incapable of producing the correct output.

**4a. The merge task.** By the correctness identity of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`, the merge map $\mathrm{merge}_n$ receives two
sub-answers $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ — partial assignments produced by recursive calls on the two
sub-instances — and must output a globally satisfying assignment $\sigma$ consistent with all
clauses, including the $\Theta(n)$ crossing clauses. Steps 2--3 established that the crossing
constraints, via the expansion cascade, couple $\Omega(n)$ variables from each partition, and
that this coupling does not shrink across recursion levels.

**4b. Pigeonhole on the merge function.** The merge is a *fixed* deterministic polynomial-time
function (item 4 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`). It receives sub-answers of
polynomial description size. By the frozen-variable structure (property (P2) of
{prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`), the frozen core occupies a $\Theta(n)$-fraction of each
partition. The solution-space shattering (property (P1)) produces $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters at
Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$. Each cluster induces a *distinct* restriction on the frozen
variables at the interface: two solutions from different clusters disagree on $\Omega(n)$ frozen
positions. Therefore, the $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints at the root split admit
$\exp(\Theta(n))$ combinatorially distinct *cluster-pair patterns* — pairs
$(\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2)$ of clusters from the two partitions that are mutually
consistent with the crossing clauses. Different cluster pairs require different satisfying
assignments (because the frozen variables within each cluster are uniquely determined on
$\Omega(n)$ positions). The merge must therefore map different cluster-pair inputs to different
outputs. But the merge is a *fixed* function — it has no auxiliary input selecting which cluster
pair is correct. It receives only the two sub-answers $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)$, which encode
which clusters were chosen by the recursive calls. The merge must, from this input alone,
produce the correct global assignment.

**4c. The merge must solve a constraint-satisfaction problem (a $\flat$-type operation).**
The $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints, restricted to the interface variables, form a 3-CNF
sub-formula $\varphi_{\mathrm{cross}}$. Given fixed sub-assignments $\sigma_1, \sigma_2$ from
the recursive calls, the merge must find values for the interface variables that satisfy
$\varphi_{\mathrm{cross}}$ — i.e., it must solve a constraint-satisfaction problem. This is a
$\flat$-type operation: algebraic elimination or constraint propagation over a structured
system. By item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous` (the $\ast$-modal restriction
on the merge map), $\mathrm{merge}_n$ cannot access the original input's constraint structure
($\flat$-type information) beyond what is encoded in the sub-answers themselves, and therefore
cannot invoke $\flat$-modal operations (Gaussian elimination, Fourier transforms, algebraic
cancellation) on the crossing clauses. The merge is structurally restricted to *recombining*
sub-answers, not to *solving fresh constraint systems* at the interface.

**4d. Alternatively, the merge must optimize over clusters (a $\sharp$-type operation).**
The cluster-pair structure means the merge must *select* which of the $\exp(\Theta(n))$
cluster pairs $(\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2)$ is globally consistent — i.e., which pair
admits a satisfying extension to the crossing clauses. This selection is a search/optimization
problem over an exponential landscape of cluster combinations: a $\sharp$-type operation
(metric descent / landscape search). Under $\ast$-purity, the merge cannot invoke $\sharp$-modal
operations (gradient descent, simulated annealing, local search with ranking functions).

**4e. The structural role of the merge is local recombination.**
The $\ast$-witness definition ({prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`) specifies that the
merge takes independently computed sub-answers and combines them. By item 8 (the $\ast$-modal
restriction), the merge is explicitly restricted to recombination operations on sub-answers and
split metadata, and cannot access the original input's constraint structure, metric landscape,
or dependency graph. The structural requirement is that the sub-answers are *compositional*:
each sub-answer is a valid partial solution that can be extended to a global solution by local
reconciliation at the interface.
The expansion-driven coupling established in Steps 2--3 shows this compositionality fails:
the sub-answers are **not** independently valid. Correctly handling the coupling requires
non-$\ast$ mechanisms:
- $\flat$-type operations for constraint satisfaction on the interface (Step 4c),
- $\sharp$-type operations for cluster selection among exponentially many candidates (Step 4d),
- $\int$-type operations for propagating consistency through the dependency structure created by
  the expansion cascade.

The merge, restricted to $\ast$-modal operations (splitting, recursing on smaller instances,
and recombining sub-answers), structurally cannot perform any of these tasks. This is not an
assertion that "many behaviors require exponential time" — a polynomial-time function can
exhibit exponentially many distinct input-output behaviors. The obstruction is that the
*specific computational task* the merge must perform (constraint satisfaction, cluster
selection, or dependency propagation) falls outside the $\ast$-modal class by definition.

*Formal closure via modal-purity violation.* We summarize the structural impossibility.
Suppose for contradiction that a pure $\ast$-witness
$(\mu_n, q_\ast, \mathrm{split}, \mathrm{merge}, \mathrm{base})$ correctly solves the hard
subfamily. Then the root merge node receives sub-answers $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ and must output a
satisfying assignment $\sigma$. Correctness requires that for each instance in the hard subfamily,
the merge produce a $\sigma$ satisfying all $\Theta(n)$ crossing clauses. By Steps 2--3, this
entails:

(i) solving a constraint-satisfaction problem on $\Theta(n)$ interface variables
(a $\flat$-type operation excluded by $\ast$-purity), or

(ii) selecting among $\exp(\Theta(n))$ cluster pairs to find one admitting a consistent
extension (a $\sharp$-type operation excluded by $\ast$-purity), or

(iii) propagating consistency corrections through the $\Omega(n)$-variable expansion cascade
(an $\int$-type operation excluded by $\ast$-purity).

Every correct merge strategy must invoke at least one of (i)--(iii). Since the merge in a pure
$\ast$-witness is restricted by item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous` to
$\ast$-modal recombination operations (assembling the global answer from sub-answers using only
sub-answers, split coordinates, and recursion-tree metadata), and none of (i)--(iii) is such an
operation, the merge cannot correctly produce the required output. This is a *representational* impossibility: the pure $\ast$-class
cannot express the computation needed at the merge step. The polynomial bound $q_\ast(n)$ is
therefore violated — not because the merge "runs out of time," but because no $\ast$-modal
merge function, regardless of its running time, can correctly perform the required task.

By Step 1b, this structural obstruction holds for *all* splitting strategies permitted by
{prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous` — balanced, unbalanced, multi-way, and lifted-state
splits alike — not merely balanced binary variable-partition splits.

**Distinction from $\partial$-blockage:**
The $\partial$-obstruction ({prf:ref}`lem-boundary-obstruction`) concerns a different mechanism:
failure of *interface contraction*. A $\partial$-witness requires that the computation factor through
a polynomial-size interface object $B_n^\partial$ with a polynomial-time contraction; treewidth
lower bounds show that any contraction must process $2^{\Omega(\operatorname{tw}(G_n))}$ feasible
separator configurations, requiring exponential time. That argument is about the *computational
cost* of processing the information that crosses a single cut. The $\ast$-obstruction proved here
concerns the *modal type* of the merge computation: the merge must perform constraint satisfaction,
cluster selection, or dependency propagation — operations that are structurally outside the
$\ast$-modal class — regardless of how the interface is represented.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Scaling obstruction covers all splitting strategies
:label: rem-scaling-all-splits

The proof of {prf:ref}`lem-scaling-obstruction` is stated for balanced partitions, but the
obstruction extends to all admissible splitting strategies in a pure $\ast$-witness:

**(a) Unbalanced splits** (one part has $\leq \epsilon n$ variables for small constant $\epsilon$):
The splitting map produces one sub-instance of size $\geq (1 - \epsilon)n$ and one of size
$\leq \epsilon n$. The large sub-instance retains the full constraint structure of the original
(by expansion: the $\leq \epsilon n$ removed variables participate in at most
$O(\epsilon \alpha n)$ clauses, while the remaining $(1-\epsilon)\alpha n - O(\epsilon\alpha n)$
clauses constrain the large part). By {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`, the size measure
$\mu$ must strictly decrease at each split. For unbalanced splits, the large sub-instance has
$\mu \geq (1-\epsilon)n$, so the recursion depth to reach base cases is at least
$n / (\epsilon n) = 1/\epsilon$. At each recursive level, the large sub-instance carries
$(1-O(\epsilon))$ of the original problem's constraint structure, including its shattering and
frozen-variable properties. The recursion therefore does not simplify the problem — it merely
trims a constant fraction of variables at each level while leaving the hard frustrated core
intact.

**(b) Non-variable-partition splits** in lifted state spaces: A pure $\ast$-witness may encode
the problem in a lifted state space and split in that space rather than along variable
boundaries. However, the correctness condition of {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`
requires that the merge of sub-answers produces a correct satisfying assignment for the
original formula. By the data processing inequality, any split-and-merge that produces a
correct output must resolve the $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints of the underlying
clause-variable graph, regardless of the encoding. Moreover, by item 8 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`, the merge map is restricted to recombination
operations on sub-answers and split metadata, and cannot access the constraint structure
directly --- so the modal-purity violation of Step 4 applies regardless of the lifted encoding.
The expansion property is a property of the formula's constraint structure, not of any
particular encoding.

**(c) Multi-way splits** ($k$-way for $k \geq 3$): Any partition of $n$ variables into $k$
parts has total crossing-clause count at least as large as the minimum binary partition's
crossing count. For random 3-SAT at threshold, the expansion property gives
$|\operatorname{boundary}| \geq c' n$ for any $k$-way partition with $k = O(1)$. For
$k = \omega(1)$, the crossing count only increases.

If the tensor network has:

blockage. The full strengthened $\partial$-obstruction theorem of Part V must additionally rule out all admissible
polynomial-size interface contractions beyond the current Pfaffian/treewidth frontends.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed witness class]:**
A pure $\partial$-witness ({prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`) requires a polynomial
$q_\partial$ bounding the description size (in bits) of all interface objects, a uniformly
polynomial-time boundary extraction map $\partial_n$, and a uniformly polynomial-time interface
contraction map $C_n^\partial$, such that the computation factors as

$$
\mathcal{A}_n = R_n^\partial \circ C_n^\partial \circ \partial_n \circ E_n^\partial.
$$

The contraction $C_n^\partial$ operates solely on the interface object $B_n^\partial$: the entire
interior of the computation is invisible to $C_n^\partial$, which sees only what has been
compressed into the interface. The exclusion target is **all** such witnesses, regardless of the
mechanism used by $C_n^\partial$. Crucially, {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous` imposes
two constraints: (i) the description size of every intermediate interface object is bounded by
$q_\partial(n)$ (a polynomial), and (ii) the contraction $C_n^\partial$ runs in time polynomial
in $q_\partial(n)$ and hence polynomial in $n$.

**Step 2. [Information-theoretic lower bound on interface capacity]:**
Because the factorization $\mathcal{A}_n = R_n^\partial \circ C_n^\partial \circ \partial_n \circ
E_n^\partial$ must be correct on **all** inputs of size $n$, the interface must separate inputs
that lead to different outputs. Formally: if $x_1, x_2$ are two inputs with
$\mathcal{A}_n(x_1) \neq \mathcal{A}_n(x_2)$, then the interface states
$\partial_n(E_n^\partial(x_1))$ and $\partial_n(E_n^\partial(x_2))$ must be distinct (otherwise
$R_n^\partial \circ C_n^\partial$ receives the same interface state and cannot produce two
different outputs). Therefore the number of distinct interface states satisfies

$$
|B_n^\partial| \;\geq\; |\{\mathcal{A}_n(x) : x \in \{0,1\}^n\}|.
$$

Since each interface state has a description of at most $q_\partial(n)$ bits, the number of
representable states is at most $2^{q_\partial(n)}$, giving

$$
q_\partial(n) \;\geq\; \log_2 |B_n^\partial|.
$$

For a search problem like 3-SAT (find a satisfying assignment), this information-theoretic bound
yields $q_\partial(n) \geq \Omega(n)$, which is satisfiable by a polynomial $q_\partial$ and
therefore does **not** by itself obstruct a pure $\partial$-witness. The obstruction must come from
the *computational* cost of the contraction, as shown in Steps 3--5.

**Step 3. [Interface bottleneck from expansion]:**
The pure $\partial$-witness factors as $\mathcal{A}_n = R_n^\partial \circ C_n^\partial \circ
\partial_n \circ E_n^\partial$. The interface object $B_n^\partial = \partial_n(E_n^\partial(x))$
has description size bounded by $q_\partial(n)$ bits. This is a polynomial bottleneck: all
information about the input that is needed to produce the correct output must pass through this
$q_\partial(n)$-bit channel.

Let $G_n$ denote the constraint graph of a random 3-SAT instance at clause-to-variable ratio
$\alpha \approx 4.267$. Its vertex expansion guarantees: for any partition of the variable set
into two parts $V_1, V_2$ with $|V_1|, |V_2| \geq \delta n$, at least
$c'' \cdot \min(|V_1|, |V_2|)$ clauses have variables in both parts. The treewidth satisfies
$\operatorname{tw}(G_n) \geq c'' \cdot n$.

The contraction $C_n^\partial$ must produce a correct satisfying assignment from $B_n^\partial$
alone. The interface $B_n^\partial$ has polynomial description size, which is sufficient to
*encode* the answer. But the contraction must be *correct for all inputs*: for each of the
exponentially many hard instances, $C_n^\partial$ must map the corresponding interface state to
the correct output. The computational cost of $C_n^\partial$ is what creates the obstruction, as
shown in Step 4.

**Step 4. [Structural modal-purity violation — the contraction cannot represent the correct computation]:**
This is the key step. We show that **correctness** of the contraction $C_n^\partial$ on all
inputs requires computational operations that are **structurally unavailable** under
$\partial$-purity. The argument is a *restricted-model impossibility*: we do not claim any
unconditional time lower bound on polynomial-time computation in general, but rather that the
class of functions computable by pure $\partial$-contractions does not contain the function
that correctness demands.

*The correctness requirement on the contraction.* The contraction $C_n^\partial$ receives the
interface object $B_n^\partial$ and must produce a satisfying assignment. By the expansion
property of $G_n$ (Step 3), any balanced partition of the variable set produces $\Theta(n)$
crossing constraints — clauses with variables on both sides. The interface $B_n^\partial$
encodes these crossing constraints through the boundary map $\partial_n$. To produce a correct
output, $C_n^\partial$ must find a variable assignment that **simultaneously satisfies all
$\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints** encoded in the interface, while remaining consistent with
the sub-computations performed on each side of the partition.

We now identify precisely what computational operation this requires, and show that this
operation falls outside the $\partial$-modal class.

**(i) The interface encodes a constraint satisfaction problem.** The $\Theta(n)$ crossing
constraints, together with the boundary conditions imposed by the sub-computations on each
side, define a **constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on the separator variables**: find an
assignment $\sigma_S : S \to \{0,1\}$ to the $\Theta(n)$ separator variables $S$ such that
every crossing clause is satisfied and $\sigma_S$ is consistent with valid extensions on
both sides.

For random 3-SAT at clause-to-variable ratio $\alpha \approx 4.267$, this interface CSP
inherits the hardness of the original instance. The $\exp(\Theta(n))$ solution clusters
(Achlioptas and Ricci-Tersenghi, 2006; Mezard and Montanari, 2009) project to
$2^{\Omega(n)}$ distinct feasible partial assignments on any $\Theta(n)$-sized separator
(by the frozen-variable spreading argument: frozen variables of each cluster comprise a
$\Theta(n)$-fraction of all variables, and the expansion property spreads them across any
$\Theta(n)$-sized set, so distinct clusters produce distinct partial assignments on the
separator). The contraction must identify which of these $2^{\Omega(n)}$ feasible partial
assignments is the correct one — i.e., it must **solve the interface CSP**.

**(ii) Solving the interface CSP requires non-$\partial$ modal operations.** We now show that
each known algorithmic route to solving this CSP belongs to a non-$\partial$ modal channel,
and that $\partial$-purity structurally forbids all of them.

- **$\flat$-type (algebraic elimination):** The interface CSP can be expressed as a system of
  polynomial equations over $\operatorname{GF}(2)$ (each clause yields a degree-$\leq 3$
  polynomial constraint). Solving such systems is the domain of Gaussian elimination,
  Gröbner bases, and the Nullstellensatz — all $\flat$-modal operations. For tractable CSP
  classes (XORSAT, systems of linear equations), these $\flat$-operations suffice. But
  $\partial$-purity forbids algebraic elimination: the contraction $C_n^\partial$ does not have
  access to the original constraint system as an algebraic object — it has only the interface
  representation $B_n^\partial$, which is a boundary/topological object, not an algebraic one.
  Item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous` explicitly excludes $\flat$-type
  operations from the contraction.

- **$\sharp$-type (metric optimization):** An alternative approach is to formulate the interface
  CSP as an optimization problem (minimize the number of violated crossing constraints) and
  apply gradient descent, simulated annealing, or survey propagation. These are $\sharp$-modal
  operations requiring access to a global energy landscape. Under $\partial$-purity, the
  contraction cannot invoke global optimization: it operates on the boundary object, not on
  an energy function over assignment space.

- **$\int$-type (causal propagation):** Unit propagation, belief propagation, and warning
  propagation solve 2-SAT and under-constrained random SAT by propagating implications along
  the dependency graph. These are $\int$-modal operations requiring the full dependency/implication
  graph structure. Under $\partial$-purity, the contraction has access only to the interface
  object, not to the original dependency graph.

- **$\ast$-type (recursive decomposition):** One could recursively decompose the interface CSP
  into smaller sub-problems. But this is $\ast$-modal recursion, and the interface CSP on
  $\Theta(n)$ separator variables with linear treewidth does not admit bounded-depth
  decomposition. Under $\partial$-purity, recursive decomposition of the interface CSP is
  excluded.

**(iii) The $\partial$-modal class cannot represent constraint satisfaction.** The permitted
operations under $\partial$-purity (item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`)
are: read/write interface bits, compose boundary maps $\partial_i : B_{n,i}^\partial \to
B_{n,i+1}^\partial$ between interface objects, and perform local consistency propagation on
$O(1)$-neighborhoods of the interface topology. The explicit $\partial$-modal restriction
(item 7) forbids global constraint satisfaction ($\flat$-type), metric optimization
($\sharp$-type), causal propagation ($\int$-type), and recursive decomposition ($\ast$-type)
on the interface data — even though the interface encodes constraint information. These
operations compute functions that are **compositions of boundary maps** — they transform
interface representations into other interface representations through local topological
operations. Formally, the function computed by $C_n^\partial$ must factor through the
$\partial$-unit $\eta^\partial_n$ (item 7).

But the function that correctness demands — mapping an interface state encoding $\Theta(n)$
crossing constraints to the unique consistent satisfying assignment — is **not** a composition
of boundary maps. It is a constraint-satisfaction operation: given a collection of constraints,
find an assignment satisfying all of them simultaneously. This is a $\flat$-modal operation
(algebraic/combinatorial satisfaction), not a $\partial$-modal operation (boundary composition).

To make this precise: the interface $B_n^\partial$ encodes $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints
$\{c_1, \ldots, c_m\}$ with $m = \Theta(n)$. The correct output requires an assignment
$\sigma_S$ satisfying $c_1 \wedge c_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge c_m$. Computing such $\sigma_S$
from the constraint encoding is precisely the operation of **solving a CSP** — this is the
defining operation of the $\flat$ modality (algebraic/logical elimination). No composition of
boundary maps can replicate this operation, because boundary maps transform *representations*
(they act on the topology of the interface), whereas constraint satisfaction requires
*searching over assignments* (acting on the algebra of the constraint system). These are
categorically distinct operations in the modal hierarchy.

**(iv) Impossibility conclusion.** Since the function that correctness demands ($\flat$-type
constraint satisfaction on the interface) is structurally outside the class of functions
computable by $\partial$-modal contractions (compositions of boundary maps), no pure
$\partial$-contraction $C_n^\partial$ can correctly solve the interface CSP for all inputs.
This is a **modal-purity violation**: the required computation does not belong to the permitted
modal class. It is analogous to the $\sharp$-blockage (where the required computation is
metric optimization, outside the $\sharp$-permitted class of energy-based contractions) and
the $\int$-blockage (where the required computation is global propagation, outside the
$\int$-permitted class of local causal updates).

This obstruction is **unconditional** within the pure-$\partial$ class. It does not assume
$\mathrm{P} \neq \mathrm{NP}$ or any other complexity-theoretic hypothesis. It derives from:
(a) the $\partial$-purity constraint (a definitional restriction on the witness class, item 7
of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`);
(b) the expansion-based interface width, which forces $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints in the
interface CSP (a proven graph property);
(c) the frozen-variable cluster structure, which ensures the interface CSP has $2^{\Omega(n)}$
distinct feasible solutions requiring correct discrimination (a proven random-CSP property); and
(d) the categorical distinction between $\partial$-modal operations (boundary composition) and
$\flat$-modal operations (constraint satisfaction), which is a structural property of the modal
hierarchy.

If a polynomial-time algorithm for 3-SAT existed, it would necessarily employ non-$\partial$
mechanisms — algebraic elimination ($\flat$), optimization ($\sharp$), propagation ($\int$), or
recursion ($\ast$) — i.e., it would not be a pure $\partial$-witness. The $\partial$-blockage
does not *by itself* prove $\mathrm{P} \neq \mathrm{NP}$; it proves that the $\partial$-channel
alone cannot solve the problem. The full separation requires blocking all five channels and
applying the mixed-modal obstruction theorem ({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`).

**Step 5. [Modal-purity violation implies no pure $\partial$-witness exists]:**
Step 4 establishes that the function computed by a correct contraction $C_n^\partial$ must
perform $\flat$-type constraint satisfaction on the $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints encoded
in the interface. By the $\partial$-modal restriction (item 7 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`), $C_n^\partial$ is confined to $\partial$-modal
operations (boundary map composition and local interface computation). Since $\flat$-type
constraint satisfaction is not in the $\partial$-modal class (it requires algebraic elimination
on the constraint system, not boundary composition on the interface representation), no function
in the $\partial$-modal class satisfies the correctness requirement.

Formally: let $\mathcal{F}_\partial$ denote the class of functions computable by $\partial$-modal
contractions on polynomial-size interface objects (compositions of boundary maps, local interface
computation), and let $f^*_n : B_n^\partial \to Y_n$ denote the unique function satisfying the
correctness identity. Step 4 shows $f^*_n \notin \mathcal{F}_\partial$ because $f^*_n$ requires
solving a CSP with $\Theta(n)$ constraints and $2^{\Omega(n)}$ feasible solutions — a $\flat$-modal
operation. Therefore no pure $\partial$-witness exists for these instances.

Note the crucial distinction from a time lower bound: we do **not** claim that $f^*_n$ requires
$2^{\Omega(n)}$ time for *any* algorithm. A polynomial-time algorithm using $\flat$-, $\sharp$-,
$\int$-, or $\ast$-modal operations might well compute $f^*_n$ efficiently. The claim is that
the **restricted class** of $\partial$-modal contractions cannot represent $f^*_n$ at all — the
function lies outside the representable class, regardless of the time budget.

**Step 6. [Universality of the obstruction]:**
The key point is that this obstruction is **not** limited to the three specific mechanisms
(planar, Pfaffian, bounded treewidth) enumerated in {prf:ref}`def-class-v-interference`. The
modal-purity violation of Step 4 is a structural obstruction on **any** factorization
through a boundary interface, because the argument depends only on three properties of the
factorization: (i) the contraction $C_n^\partial$ is $\partial$-modal (restricted to boundary
map composition and local interface computation), (ii) correctness demands solving a CSP on
$\Theta(n)$ separator variables with $2^{\Omega(n)}$ feasible solutions ($\flat$-modal
operation), and (iii) $\flat$-modal operations are structurally outside the $\partial$-modal
class. These three properties hold for *any* pure $\partial$-witness, regardless of the
mechanism used to construct the boundary map $\partial_n$ or the contraction $C_n^\partial$.
No matter what $\partial$-modal contraction $C_n^\partial$ employs — even one not yet
conceived — it cannot perform the $\flat$-type constraint satisfaction that correctness
requires. This addresses the universality concern flagged in
{prf:ref}`rem-why-boundary-strengthening-is-mandatory`.

### The Theorem Ladder Required for Algorithmic Completeness

:::{prf:remark} Why this section is necessary
:label: rem-why-theorem-ladder-is-necessary

The previous sections define effective Fragile programs, the evaluator $\mathsf{Eval}$, the cost-certificate
predicate $\mathsf{CostCert}$, the five modalities $\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\}$, and the saturated modal
closure $\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle$.

However, those ingredients alone do **not** yet justify either:
1. the bridge equivalence

   $$
   P_{\mathrm{FM}}=P_{\mathrm{DTM}},
   \qquad
   NP_{\mathrm{FM}}=NP_{\mathrm{DTM}},
   $$

2. the stronger claim

   $$
   P_{\mathrm{FM}}=\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle.
   $$

The present section states the exact theorem package needed to make those identifications rigorous. The theorems are
organized so that:
- Part I isolates semantic adequacy and machine equivalence;
- Part II isolates the internal normalization machinery;
- Part III isolates the universal-property characterization of the five modal classes.

No theorem in Parts II-III may be used to prove Part I, and no theorem in Part III may be used to define
$P_{\mathrm{FM}}$. This separation prevents circularity.

:::{prf:definition} Concrete evaluator implementation for Part I
:label: def-concrete-evaluator-implementation

For Part I, we fix the canonical evaluator implementing the runtime of
{prf:ref}`def-effective-programs-fragile` as a deterministic multi-tape interpreter with the following data.

1. **Finite syntax alphabet.** Program codes are finite parse trees, equivalently finite bytecode streams, over a fixed
   finite constructor alphabet

   $$
   \Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}}
   =
   \{\mathsf{const},\mathsf{pair},\mathsf{fst},\mathsf{snd},\mathsf{inl},\mathsf{inr},\mathsf{case},
   \mathsf{lookup},\mathsf{extend},\mathsf{call},\mathsf{ret},\mathsf{branch},\mathsf{halt}\}
   \cup
   \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}},
   $$
   where $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ is a fixed finite library of basic binary-string, arithmetic, and finite-map
   routines.

2. **Read-only code tape.** The program code $a\in\mathsf{Prog}_{\mathrm{FM}}$ is stored once on a read-only code tape.
   Runtime states may store only addresses into that tape.

3. **Runtime configuration format.** A runtime configuration is a finite tagged tuple

   $$
   C=(q,p,\kappa,\rho,\sigma,\eta,\iota,\omega),
   $$
   where:
   - $q$ is a control state from a fixed finite set;
   - $p$ is a code-tape address;
   - $\kappa$ is a finite continuation stack of return addresses and branch tags;
   - $\rho$ is a finite environment of addresses into the work tapes;
   - $\sigma$ is a finite value stack;
   - $\eta$ is a finite heap / association-list store;
   - $\iota$ is the current pair of input/output tapes;
   - $\omega$ is a halting-status flag from a fixed finite set.

4. **Microstep semantics.** The evaluator transition relation

   $$
   C \leadsto C'
   $$
   is the deterministic one-step transition relation of that interpreter. Large arithmetic or string operations are not
   atomic evaluator steps: when the current opcode lies in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$, the evaluator enters the
   corresponding primitive subroutine and executes it by microsteps over the work tapes.

5. **Bit-cost primitive library.** Each primitive subroutine in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ acts on binary encodings by
   reading/writing $O(1)$ tape cells per microstep, changing only finitely many head positions and control tags at each
   step. In particular, the cost of executing a primitive is the number of microsteps of its subroutine, which is
   polynomial in the sizes of the encoded operands. No primitive treats exponentially large integers or exponentially
   long strings as unit-cost objects.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Primitive Library $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$
:label: def-primitive-library-sigma-prim

The primitive library $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ is the following fixed finite set of polynomial-time
subroutines operating on binary-string tape cells:

**Binary-string operations:**
`bit-read(i)`, `bit-write(i,b)`, `bit-length(s)`, `concat(s_1,s_2)`, `substring(s,i,j)`.

**Arithmetic operations:**
`add(x,y)`, `sub(x,y)` (saturating), `mul(x,y)`, `div(x,y)` (integer), `mod(x,y)`, `cmp(x,y)`.

**Finite-map operations:**
`map-create()`, `map-get(m,k)`, `map-set(m,k,v)`, `map-has(m,k)`.

Each operation runs in time polynomial in the bit-length of its arguments and reads/writes $O(1)$
tape cells per microstep ({prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`, clause 5).

:::{prf:lemma} Turing Completeness of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$
:label: lem-sigma-prim-turing-complete

The evaluator instruction set $\Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}} \cup \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ from
{prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation` and {prf:ref}`def-primitive-library-sigma-prim`
is Turing-complete with at most polynomial overhead.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
To simulate an arbitrary Turing machine $M$ with state set $Q$, tape alphabet $\Gamma$, and
transition function $\delta$: (1) represent the tape as a finite map via `map-create`/`map-set`/
`map-get`; (2) store the current state $q$ and head position $h$ as binary integers in dedicated
tape cells; (3) simulate each TM step by reading the current symbol via `map-get(tape, h)`,
computing $\delta(q, \sigma)$ via finite case analysis using `cmp` and `branch`, writing the new
symbol, and updating $h$ via `add`/`sub`. Each simulated TM step uses $O(|Q|\cdot|\Gamma|)$
evaluator microsteps — a constant independent of input size. A TM computation of $T$ steps is
simulated in $O(T)$ evaluator microsteps with $O(S)$ space for $S$ tape cells used.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Bit-cost evaluator discipline
:label: thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline

The concrete evaluator of {prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation` satisfies the following properties.

1. **Finite configuration alphabet.** Every runtime configuration is a finite record over a fixed finite tag alphabet,
   together with finitely many finite strings over $\{0,1\}$.
2. **Read-only program code.** The code of a program is stored in read-only form and is not duplicated unboundedly
   during execution.
3. **Decidable one-step semantics.** There is a decidable one-step transition relation

   $$
   C \leadsto C'
   $$
   on encoded configurations.
4. **Local size discipline.** There exists a linear polynomial

   $$
   s(N)=N+c
   $$
   such that if one primitive evaluator microstep transforms an encoded configuration of bitlength $N$ into one of
   bitlength $N'$, then

   $$
   N' \le s(N).
   $$
   Consequently, for configurations reachable in $t$ steps from a program of size $|a|$ and an input of size $n$, the
   encoded configuration size is bounded by a polynomial in $(|a|,n,t)$.
5. **Bit-cost primitive accounting.** Arithmetic and data-structure operations are costed according to the size of the
   encoded operands; there is no hidden unit-cost treatment of exponentially large integers or exponentially long
   intermediate strings.

Equivalently: the evaluator discipline required for export to DTMs is a theorem of the fixed Part I runtime, not an
external assumption.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Clauses (1) and (2) are immediate from
{prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation`: the sets of control tags, halting flags, bytecode constructors, and
primitive-subroutine states are all finite, and the program code lives on a read-only tape addressed by pointers.

For clause (3), decoding an encoded configuration is polynomial-time by the self-delimiting pairing convention of
{prf:ref}`rem-ambient-conventions-complexity`. Once decoded, the next step is determined by finite case analysis on the
current control state $q$ and opcode pointed to by $p$. Each branch updates only finitely many fields, and each
primitive branch advances one microstep of a fixed deterministic subroutine. Hence the one-step relation is decidable on
encoded configurations.

For clause (4), let $N$ be the encoded size of $C$. A single evaluator microstep either:
- changes only finitely many control tags, head positions, or pointers;
- pushes or pops one address-sized item from $\kappa$, $\rho$, or $\sigma$;
- updates one heap or tape cell by a single binary symbol; or
- advances one primitive subroutine by one microstep, which by definition reads/writes $O(1)$ cells and changes only
  finitely many control tags and head positions.

Therefore there exists a constant $c$ such that every microstep changes the encoded configuration length by at most $c$,
so

$$
N' \le N+c = s(N).
$$
If the initial tagged input has size at most $c_0(|a|+n+1)$, then after at most $t$ microsteps every reachable
configuration has encoded size at most

$$
c_0(|a|+n+1)+ct,
$$
which is polynomial in $(|a|,n,t)$.

For clause (5), the primitive library is executed only through the microstep semantics just described. Its running time
is therefore the number of microsteps used by the corresponding subroutine, which is polynomial in operand size by
construction. Since no primitive subroutine takes a whole exponentially large integer or string as a unit-cost atom, the
runtime is a genuine bit-cost model.

   where $q_a$ is polynomial in $(|a|,n,t)$.
3. The corresponding validity predicate and decoder are uniformly computable in time polynomial in $(|a|,n,t)$ and
   the configuration code length.

Hence every admissible problem family and every runtime configuration family used in the framework is externally
representable by finite bitstrings with polynomial overhead.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Clause (1) is immediate from {prf:ref}`def-admissible-input-family-rigorous`.

For clauses (2) and (3), fix $a$ and $\mathfrak{X}$. By
{prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`, every runtime configuration is a finite record consisting of:
- a program counter or evaluation-context pointer into the fixed code of $a$,
- finitely many finite work registers, stacks, heaps, or environments,
- the current encoded input/output fragments,
- finitely many control flags.

Because the code of $a$ is read-only, its contribution to configuration size is $O(|a|)$. Because one-step semantics
is decidable and obeys the local size discipline, every configuration reachable in at most $t$ steps from an input of
size $n$ has total bitlength bounded by some polynomial $q_a(n,t)$ obtained from the reachable-size bound in
{prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`.

Encode a configuration by concatenating its tagged fields using the fixed self-delimiting pairing convention from
{prf:ref}`rem-ambient-conventions-complexity`. This yields an injective encoding into
$\{0,1\}^{q_a(n,t)}$. Validity checking and decoding are polynomial-time because the field grammar is finite, the tags
are finite, and each field decoder is polynomial-time by construction.

$$
\mathsf{Eval}(a,u)\downarrow_t v
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
U(\ulcorner a\urcorner,u)\downarrow_{\le r(|a|,|u|,t)} v.

Equivalently: the operational semantics of the Fragile evaluator is DTM-simulable with polynomial slowdown in program
size, input size, and internal step count.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Fix a concrete encoding of programs and runtime configurations. By {prf:ref}`thm-finite-encodability`, every
configuration reachable within $t$ steps from input $u$ has encoded size bounded by a polynomial
$q(|a|,|u|,t)$.

Construct $U$ as follows. On input $(\ulcorner a\urcorner,u)$:
1. compute the initial encoded runtime configuration $C_0$;
2. repeatedly:
   - test whether the current configuration is halting,
   - if not, compute the unique next configuration under the one-step semantics;
3. when a halting configuration is reached, decode and output its result.

Because the one-step relation is decidable, each simulated evaluator step is computable on a DTM. Because the encoded
configuration size at time $i\le t$ is bounded by $q(|a|,|u|,t)$, the DTM time to simulate one evaluator step is
bounded by a polynomial in that quantity. Therefore the total time for simulating $t$ evaluator steps is bounded by a
polynomial $r(|a|,|u|,t)$.

Correctness follows by induction on the length-$t$ evaluator run: the DTM maintains exactly the encoded evaluator
configuration that the Fragile semantics would produce after the same number of internal steps.

in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-uniform-algorithm-family-rigorous`, every evaluation on a valid tagged
$\mathfrak X$-input halts with an output bitstring $v$ satisfying

$$
\chi^{\mathfrak Y}_{\sigma(n)}(v)=1.
$$
Thus every such output is a valid $\mathfrak Y$-code of size $\sigma(n)$.

Clause (3) follows from {prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`: each counted runtime step is a primitive
microstep of the fixed Fragile evaluator, and its accounting is by encoded operand size.

For clause (4), take as certificate payload the tuple

$$
W(a,q):=(q,\Pi_{\mathrm{halt}},\Pi_{\mathrm{out}},\Pi_{\mathrm{step}},\Pi_{\mathrm{adm}}),
$$
where:
- $\Pi_{\mathrm{halt}}$ is the formal record of the displayed halting bound;
- $\Pi_{\mathrm{out}}$ is the family-representation record witnessing output validity for
  $\mathcal A:\mathfrak X\Rightarrow_{\sigma}\mathfrak Y$;
- $\Pi_{\mathrm{step}}$ records that counted steps are evaluator primitives under
  {prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`;
- $\Pi_{\mathrm{adm}}$ is the admissible-family data for $\mathfrak X$ and $\mathfrak Y$.

This package is ZFC-checkable because programs have concrete syntax and ZFC-definable operational semantics by
{prf:ref}`def-effective-programs-fragile`, admissible families come with uniform encoders, decoders, and validity
predicates by {prf:ref}`def-admissible-input-family-rigorous`, and reachable evaluator configurations admit finite
encodings with polynomial-time validity and decoding by {prf:ref}`thm-finite-encodability`.

Therefore $W(a,q)$ witnesses

$$
\mathsf{FamCostCert}_{\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y,\sigma}(a,q).

of

Accordingly, the class

be a deterministic Turing machine running in time bounded by a polynomial $q$.
Then there exists an admissible family of internal configuration objects

$$

together with uniformly computable maps:

$$
\mathrm{init}_{M,n}: \{0,1\}^{\le n}\to \mathrm{Conf}_{M,n},

such that:

1. $\mathrm{Conf}_{M,n}$ encodes exactly the machine configurations reachable within $q(n)$ steps on size-$n$ inputs;
2. for every input $u$ and every $t\le q(n)$,

   $$
   \mathrm{step}_{M,n}^{\,t}(\mathrm{init}_{M,n}(u))

   is the internal image of the external machine configuration after $t$ steps of $M$ on $u$;
3. if $M$ halts on $u$ within $t\le q(n)$ steps, then

   $$
   \mathrm{out}_{M,n}\!\left(\mathrm{step}_{M,n}^{\,t}(\mathrm{init}_{M,n}(u))\right)
   $$

   is exactly the output of $M$ on $u$.

Equivalently, one may form a tagged object

$$
\mathrm{Conf}_M := \coprod_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathrm{Conf}_{M,n}\in \mathbf H
$$

together with a global step morphism over the size index.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
For an input of length $n$, a time bound $q(n)$ implies that the head never needs to inspect more than the first
$q(n)$ tape cells. Thus a configuration may be encoded by the finite tuple

$$
(q_{\mathrm{state}}, i, w)
$$

where $q_{\mathrm{state}}\in Q$ is the current control state, $i\in\{0,\dots,q(n)\}$ is the head position, and
$w\in \Gamma^{q(n)+1}$ is the tape contents on the bounded active tape segment. This space is finite and therefore
$0$-truncated and finitely encodable.

Define $\mathrm{init}_{M,n}$ by writing the input on the left portion of the active tape and blank symbols elsewhere.
Define $\mathrm{step}_{M,n}$ by applying the transition function $\delta$ to the triple consisting of the current
state, current tape symbol, and head position, then updating the bounded tape word accordingly. The maps
$\mathrm{halt}_{M,n}$ and $\mathrm{out}_{M,n}$ are the obvious decoders for halting states and output tape contents.

Because $M$ is deterministic, these maps are well-defined; because $Q$, $\Gamma$, and $\delta$ are finite, they are
uniformly computable. Induction on $t$ proves the agreement between the internal iterates of $\mathrm{step}_{M,n}$ and
the external machine evolution.

2. $\mathsf{FamCostCert}_{\mathfrak{X},\mathfrak{Y},\sigma}(a_M,p_M)$ holds;
3. $p_M$ is polynomially bounded in the original DTM runtime bound $q$.

Hence every uniform DTM computation of polynomial time admits a uniform internal realization in the Fragile model with
polynomial overhead.

Define $a_M$ to:
1. encode the input into the initial machine configuration $\mathrm{init}_{M,n}(x)$;
2. iterate $\mathrm{step}_{M,n}$ for at most $q(n)$ stages;
3. stop when $\mathrm{halt}_{M,n}$ becomes true;
4. decode the output tape via $\mathrm{out}_{M,n}$.

Because $M$ halts within $q(n)$ steps on all valid inputs, the iteration bound is polynomial. Each simulated machine
step is realized by a uniformly bounded amount of internal evaluator work, so the total internal runtime is polynomial
in $q(n)$. Therefore $a_M$ carries a family cost certificate, and the extensional equality with $M$ follows from the
correctness of the configuration simulation.

#### II. Internal Normal Forms for Algorithms

:::{prf:definition} Normal-form language for internal algorithms
:label: def-normal-form-language

Let $\mathsf{NF}$ be the smallest class of uniform algorithm families generated by the following constructors.

1. **Primitive local operations.** Identity, constants, projections, injections, finite arity arithmetic/data
   constructors, and every primitive evaluator-level operation whose bit-cost is polynomial in operand size.
2. **Finite products and sums.** Pairing, projections, tagged sums, and case analysis on tagged sums under the
   standard admissible encodings.
3. **Composition.** If $F,G\in \mathsf{NF}$ are composable, then $G\circ F\in\mathsf{NF}$.
4. **Bounded iteration.** If $F:\mathfrak X\Rightarrow \mathfrak X$ lies in $\mathsf{NF}$ and
   $k:\mathbb N\to\mathbb N$ is polynomial, then

   $$
   \mathrm{Iter}_k(F)_n := F_n^{\,k(n)}
   $$

   lies in $\mathsf{NF}$.
5. **Finite well-founded recursion.** If a family is defined by a recursion scheme whose split, merge, and
   size-decrease maps are already in $\mathsf{NF}$ and whose recursion tree has polynomial size, then it lies in
   $\mathsf{NF}$.
6. **Presentation translators.** Every presentation translator of {prf:ref}`def-presentation-translator` belongs to
   $\mathsf{NF}$.
7. **Modal lift/restrict maps.** For each modality $\lozenge\in\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\}$, every modal
   encoding map $E^\lozenge$ and reconstruction map $R^\lozenge$ appearing in a pure witness belongs to
   $\mathsf{NF}$.

An element of $\mathsf{NF}$ is called a **normal-form family**.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Syntax-to-Normal-Form
:label: thm-syntax-to-normal-form

Every effective Fragile program admits an administrative normal form over primitive local operations, products/sums,
composition, and explicit recursion/iteration combinators.

More precisely:

1. **Administrative normal form for all effective programs.**
   Every effective Fragile program is extensionally equivalent to a term in the closure of primitive local operations,
   products/sums, composition, and explicit recursion operators.
2. **Polynomial normal form for certified programs.**
   If an effective Fragile program represents a family in

   $$
   P_{\mathrm{FM}}(\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y;\sigma),
   $$

   then it is extensionally equivalent to a normal-form family in $\mathsf{NF}$ of
   {prf:ref}`def-normal-form-language`, i.e. one using only bounded iteration, polynomially bounded well-founded
   recursion, presentation translators, and modal lift/restrict maps.

Thus the polynomial-time fragment of the internal language admits a syntax-independent normal form governed by the
constructors of $\mathsf{NF}$.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Clause (1).** By {prf:ref}`def-effective-programs-fragile`, every effective Fragile program $a$ has a concrete
representation as a finite parse tree (equivalently, a finite bytecode stream) over the fixed constructor alphabet
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}} \cup \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ of {prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation`. The 13
control constructors ($\mathsf{const}$, $\mathsf{pair}$, $\mathsf{fst}$, $\mathsf{snd}$, $\mathsf{inl}$,
$\mathsf{inr}$, $\mathsf{case}$, $\mathsf{lookup}$, $\mathsf{extend}$, $\mathsf{call}$, $\mathsf{ret}$,
$\mathsf{branch}$, $\mathsf{halt}$) together with the finite primitive library $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ form a
finite base. By structural induction on the syntax tree: each leaf maps to a primitive local operation (NF
constructor 1), each pairing/case node maps to a finite product or sum (constructor 2), each sequential composition
maps to NF composition (constructor 3), and each recursive definition maps to an explicit recursion operator
(constructor 5). The result is an $\mathsf{NF}$ term extensionally equivalent to $a$.

**Clause (2).** We use an interpreter self-simulation strategy: rather than analyzing the internal control-flow
structure of $a$, we simulate the evaluator's own execution as an NF family.

**Step 1.** *[Cost certificate.]*
Let $\mathcal{A} : \mathfrak{X} \Rightarrow_\sigma \mathfrak{Y}$ be the family represented by $a$, with
$\mathcal{A} \in P_{\mathrm{FM}}(\mathfrak{X}, \mathfrak{Y}; \sigma)$. Choose a family cost certificate
$\mathsf{FamCostCert}_{\mathfrak{X},\mathfrak{Y},\sigma}(a, p)$ per {prf:ref}`def-family-cost-certificate`. This
provides a polynomial $p(n)$ bounding the number of evaluator microsteps on every input of parameter $n$.

**Step 2.** *[Configuration encoding.]*
By {prf:ref}`def-reachable-evaluator-config-family`, the set $\mathrm{Conf}^{\mathfrak{X}}_a(n, p(n))$ of
configurations reachable in $\leq p(n)$ steps is well-defined. By {prf:ref}`thm-finite-encodability` (clause 2),
these configurations admit binary encodings of length $q_a(n, p(n))$, which is polynomial in $n$ since $p$ is
polynomial. The encoding, decoding, and validity predicate are uniformly computable in polynomial time (clause 3).

**Step 3.** *[Init map $\in \mathsf{NF}$.]*
Define $\mathrm{init}_n$ by mapping the tagged input $\langle \ulcorner n \urcorner, \mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{X}}_n(x)
\rangle$ to the encoding of the initial evaluator configuration $C_0 = (q_{\mathrm{start}}, 0, \kappa_0, \rho_0,
\sigma_0, \eta_0, \iota_0, \omega_0)$ from {prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation` (clause 3), where
$\iota_0$ places the tagged input on the input tape and all other components are fixed constants determined by the
program code $a$. This is a pairing of the input encoding with fixed data — built from primitive operations (NF
constructor 1) and products (NF constructor 2). Hence $\mathrm{init} \in \mathsf{NF}$.

**Step 4.** *[Step map $\in \mathsf{NF}$.]*
Define $\mathrm{step}_n : \{0,1\}^{q_a(n,p(n))} \to \{0,1\}^{q_a(n,p(n))}$ as one evaluator microstep applied to
an encoded configuration. Concretely, $\mathrm{step}_n$ decodes the configuration bitstring, applies the microstep
transition $C \leadsto C'$, and re-encodes; the decode and encode maps are polynomial-time by
{prf:ref}`thm-finite-encodability` (clause 3), hence NF primitives. The microstep itself dispatches on the current
opcode from the finite set $\Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}} \cup \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$: by
{prf:ref}`thm-evaluator-to-semantic-reduction`, the 13 control instructions are administrative reductions, and each
primitive in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ reads/writes $O(1)$ tape cells per microstep
({prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`, clause 5). The dispatch is a finite case analysis (NF constructor 2)
and each branch applies a primitive update (NF constructor 1). On halted configurations
($\omega = \mathsf{halt}$), $\mathrm{step}_n$ acts as the identity. Composing decode, dispatch, and re-encode by
NF constructor 3, we obtain $\mathrm{step} \in \mathsf{NF}$.

**Step 5.** *[Bounded iteration.]*
Define $\mathrm{Iter}_p(\mathrm{step})_n := \mathrm{step}_n^{\,p(n)}$. Since $\mathrm{step} \in \mathsf{NF}$ and
$p$ is polynomial, this is an instance of NF constructor 4 (bounded iteration). Hence
$\mathrm{Iter}_p(\mathrm{step}) \in \mathsf{NF}$.

**Step 6.** *[Output extraction $\in \mathsf{NF}$.]*
Define $\mathrm{out}_n : \{0,1\}^{q_a(n,p(n))} \to \{0,1\}^{\sigma(n)}$ by decoding the configuration tuple and
extracting the output-tape contents from the $\iota$ component. This is a projection followed by a bounded read —
built from primitive operations (NF constructor 1) and products (NF constructor 2). Hence
$\mathrm{out} \in \mathsf{NF}$.

**Step 7.** *[Composition.]*
Set $F_n := \mathrm{out}_n \circ \mathrm{Iter}_p(\mathrm{step}_n) \circ \mathrm{init}_n$. By two applications of
NF constructor 3 (composition), $F \in \mathsf{NF}$.

**Step 8.** *[Extensional equality.]*
Fix $n$ and $x \in X_n$. By clause (1) of $\mathsf{FamCostCert}(a, p)$, the evaluator halts within some
$t \leq p(n)$ steps. After $t$ iterations of $\mathrm{step}_n$, the configuration is halted; the remaining
$p(n) - t$ iterations apply $\mathrm{step}_n$ to a halted configuration, which acts as the identity (Step 4).
Therefore $\mathrm{Iter}_p(\mathrm{step}_n)(\mathrm{init}_n(x))$ encodes the final halted configuration. Since $a$
represents $\mathcal{A}$, the output tape of that configuration contains
$\mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{Y}}_{\sigma(n)}(\mathcal{A}_n(x))$, and clause (2) of $\mathsf{FamCostCert}$ confirms it
is a valid $\mathfrak{Y}$-code. Output extraction therefore returns exactly
$\mathrm{enc}^{\mathfrak{Y}}_{\sigma(n)}(\mathcal{A}_n(x))$. Hence $F \equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} \mathcal{A}$.

The stronger implementation theorem one may still want is different. It would start from a true evaluator bound

$$

for an effective program $a$, pass through clause (1) of {prf:ref}`thm-syntax-to-normal-form`, decorate the

- halting traces

- and a strictly increasing reindexing map

such that:
1. the initial and terminal configurations of the two traces correspond under the same admissible input/output
   encodings;
2. each step of $\tau_F(n,x)$ is matched by the corresponding reindexed step of $\tau_G(n,x)$ under $\rho_{n,x}$.

Then:

$$
F \equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} G.
$$

If, moreover, one of the two families belongs to

then so does the other.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The trace correspondence hypothesis implies that, on each valid input, both normalized programs start from the same
encoded input configuration and end at the same encoded output configuration. Therefore their decoded outputs coincide
on every input, which is extensional equality.

If $F$ is internally polynomial-time and the reindexing map is polynomially bounded, then the length of each trace of
$G$ is polynomially bounded whenever the corresponding trace of $F$ is polynomially bounded. The same argument in the
reverse direction proves preservation of complexity class.

Equivalently, if a polynomial-time family is expressed in normal form using:

- products/sums,
- composition,
- bounded iteration,
- finite well-founded recursion,
- presentation translators,
- modal lift/restrict maps,

and if every nontrivial leaf computation admits a pure modal witness, then the whole family lies in

:::

:::{prf:proof}
Closure under composition, presentation translators, bounded iteration, and finite recursion is built into
{prf:ref}`def-saturated-modal-closure-rigorous`.

It remains only to account for primitive local operations and finite sums. Primitive local operations are either
presentation translators or constant-size pure witnesses, hence belong to the saturated class. Finite products are
already included in the definition of saturation. Finite sums and case analysis are encoded by the standard admissible
tagged-sum encodings; after tagging, case analysis decomposes into presentation translators together with product-style
branch selection, so it also belongs to the saturated class.

Therefore every constructor from {prf:ref}`def-normal-form-language` preserves saturation.

1. $\mathcal A \triangleright \sharp$.
2. $\mathcal A$ admits a pure $\sharp$-witness in the sense of

3. Equivalently, there exist:
   - polynomially computable lifted state spaces $Y_n^\sharp$,
   - a uniformly polynomial-time ranking/Lyapunov family

     $$
     V_n:Y_n^\sharp\to \mathbb N

   such that

   $$
   z\notin S_n^\sharp \implies V_n(F_n(z))\le V_n(z)-1,
   $$

   and the original family is recovered by polynomial-time modal encoding and reconstruction maps.

Thus the universal property of the $\sharp$-class is certified monotone descent in a polynomially bounded potential.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**(2)↔(3).** Condition (3) is the explicit unpacking of the data in
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`; the equivalence is definitional.

set the abstract modal factorization data of {prf:ref}`def-abstract-modal-factorization` by
taking the intermediate space to be $Z_n^\sharp$, the encoding to be $E_n^\sharp$, the reconstruction
to be $R_n^\sharp$, and the core map to be $F_n^\sharp$. The ranking function $V_n^\sharp$, solved set
$S_n^\sharp$, and the descent condition $V_n^\sharp(F_n^\sharp(z)) \le V_n^\sharp(z) - 1$ for
$z \notin S_n^\sharp$ certify that $F_n^\sharp$ carries the $\sharp$-universal property: monotone
descent in a polynomially bounded potential.

:label: rem-why-flat-strengthening-is-mandatory

A classification of the $\flat$-class purely in terms of automorphism groups, lattice compression, or obvious quotient
symmetry is too narrow. Polynomial-time algebraic speedups can arise from cancellation, rank phenomena, and succinct
lifted representations even when the original instance has trivial visible symmetry. Therefore any acceptable
$\flat$-universality theorem must range over **all** admissible polynomial-size algebraic sketches, not just
group-action examples.

Let

\mathcal A:\mathfrak X\Rightarrow_{\sigma}\mathfrak Y

$$

be uniform algorithm families.

1. If $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ admit modal profiles

   $$
   \pi_{\mathcal A},\ \pi_{\mathcal B},
   $$

   then the composite

   $$
   \mathcal B\circ \mathcal A
   $$

   admits a finite modal profile

   $$
   \pi_{\mathcal B}\star \pi_{\mathcal A},
   $$

   obtained by grafting the output root of $\pi_{\mathcal A}$ to the input root of $\pi_{\mathcal B}$ and simplifying
   translator-conjugation nodes.
2. Conversely, every finite modal profile built from pure witnesses computes a family in

   $$
   P_{\mathrm{FM}}.
   $$

3. Hence every family admitting a finite modal profile belongs to

   $$
   \mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle,
   $$

   and every family in the saturated modal closure is internally polynomial-time.

Thus mixed algorithms are represented honestly by finite modal profiles rather than by forcing a spurious
classification into a single pure class.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Part (1) is immediate from the inductive definition of modal profiles in
{prf:ref}`def-modal-profile-rigorous`: composition is one of the allowed profile constructors, and translator nodes may
be merged by composition of presentation translators.

For part (2), each pure witness has an internally polynomial-time middle stage by definition, and each outer
translator is polynomial-time. The closure operations allowed in a modal profile are precisely those shown in
{prf:ref}`thm-modal-profile-closure` to preserve internal polynomial time. Therefore the denotation of any finite
modal profile lies in $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$.

Part (3) is the translation between the profile viewpoint and the definition of saturated modal closure in
{prf:ref}`def-saturated-modal-closure-rigorous`.

:::{prf:remark} What Parts I-III achieve

If Parts I-III are established, then the manuscript has:
1. a noncircular bridge between internal computation and classical machine computation;
2. a syntax-independent normal form for the polynomial-time fragment;
3. universal-property characterizations of each modal class that are broad enough to cover real algorithmic
   mechanisms, not merely example lists.

What still remains after that is the hardest step:

$$
P_{\mathrm{FM}}=\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle,
$$

together with the soundness-and-completeness of the five obstruction schemas for the target problem family.
That is the subject of the next theorem block.
:::

### IV. Classification and Exhaustiveness

:::{div} feynman-prose
Now we reach the point where the bridge theorems, the normal-form language, and the five universality theorems have to
be assembled into actual algorithmic completeness. That burden is too large for a single slogan-level theorem. It has
to be broken into a ladder: primitive audit, witness decomposition, irreducible classification, and exhaustiveness.

That is not cosmetic. It is what makes the framework referee-proof. A critic can now challenge a specific theorem in
the ladder instead of objecting vaguely that "maybe there is a sixth kind of algorithm."
:::

:::{prf:remark} Role of Part IV
:label: rem-role-of-part-iv

Parts I-III provide:
1. a non-circular machine-semantic bridge,
2. a normal-form language for internally polynomial-time algorithms,
3. and universal-property characterizations of the five modal classes.

Part IV is the point at which those ingredients must be assembled into the actual algorithmic completeness theorem.
This is the heart of the framework. In particular, the statements below are the ones that must bear the burden of the
claim that there is no hidden sixth computational mechanism beyond the five modal classes.

Nothing in this section may be proved merely by repeating the slogan "the topos has no sixth modality." The theorems
here concern computational witnesses, normal-form programs, and polynomial-time factorization trees. They are therefore
stronger than ambient structural decomposition statements about objects of $\mathbf H$.

:::{prf:definition} Administrative versus progress-producing primitive leaves
:label: def-administrative-vs-progress-primitive

Let

$$
F:\mathfrak X\Rightarrow_{\sigma}\mathfrak Y
$$
be a normal-form family in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-normal-form-language`.

A primitive leaf of the syntax tree of $F$ is called administrative if it is extensionally equivalent to one of the
following:
1. a presentation translator;
2. the identity map;
3. a projection, injection, tag introduction, tag elimination, tuple rearrangement, or other fixed-arity structural
   reindexing map;
4. a constant-size branch selector or other control-only operation whose semantic role is solely to dispatch already
   available data.

A primitive leaf is called progress-producing if it is not administrative.

Equivalently: administrative leaves merely present, route, or repackage data, whereas progress-producing leaves are the
primitive semantic steps that perform the nontrivial algorithmic work counted by the complexity witness.

For the avoidance of doubt, the classification administrative versus progress-producing is part of the formal audit of
the runtime instruction set and must be fixed once and for all.
:::

:::{prf:remark} The primitive audit is a finite proof obligation
:label: rem-primitive-audit-finite-obligation

Because the runtime instruction set is fixed and finite, the classification demanded by
{prf:ref}`def-administrative-vs-progress-primitive` is a finite proof obligation.

A complete manuscript should include, preferably in an appendix, a table listing every primitive evaluator instruction
and recording for each one:
1. whether it is administrative;
2. if it is progress-producing, which of the universal properties of
   {prf:ref}`thm-sharp-universality`--{prf:ref}`thm-boundary-universality` it satisfies;
3. the associated local soundness proof and complexity bound.

A hostile referee is entitled to demand this table. This table is provided in
{prf:ref}`thm-appendix-a-primitive-audit-table`.
:::

:::{prf:lemma} Primitive Step Classification
:label: lem-primitive-step-classification

Every primitive progress-producing leaf appearing in the normal form of
{prf:ref}`thm-syntax-to-normal-form` admits a pure $\lozenge$-witness for at least one
$\lozenge\in\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\}$, in the sense of the witness definitions
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`--{prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`.

More precisely, let

$$
p:\mathfrak U\Rightarrow_{\tau}\mathfrak V
$$
be a primitive progress-producing leaf. Then there exists at least one

$$
\lozenge\in\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\}
$$
such that $p$ admits a pure $\lozenge$-witness after, if necessary, conjugation by presentation translators:

$$
p \equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} R^\lozenge \circ F^\lozenge \circ E^\lozenge.
$$

The choice of $\lozenge$ need not be unique. A primitive may satisfy more than one universal property, but it must
satisfy at least one.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
By {prf:ref}`def-normal-form-language`, every primitive leaf is drawn from the fixed finite runtime instruction set.
Partition that instruction set according to {prf:ref}`def-administrative-vs-progress-primitive`. Administrative leaves
are irrelevant to the present lemma.

For each progress-producing primitive instruction $\pi$, consult the primitive audit required by
{prf:ref}`rem-primitive-audit-finite-obligation`. By construction of that audit, $\pi$ is accompanied by:
1. a designation of at least one modality

   $$
   \lozenge_\pi\in\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\},
   $$
2. a modality-specific certificate exhibiting $\pi$ as satisfying the corresponding universal property,
3. and explicit presentation translators, when needed, to place the primitive in the standard source/target form of the
   pure witness definitions.

This yields a pure witness

$$
p \equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} R^{\lozenge_\pi}\circ F^{\lozenge_\pi}\circ E^{\lozenge_\pi}.
$$

Because the instruction set is finite, this proof is a finite case analysis. The complete audit is carried out in
{prf:ref}`thm-appendix-a-primitive-audit-table`.

:::{prf:definition} Modal factorization tree

A modal factorization tree for a uniform family

$$
\mathcal A:\mathfrak X\Rightarrow_{\sigma}\mathfrak Y
$$
is a modal profile in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-modal-profile-rigorous`.

Thus:
- the leaves are pure modal witnesses;
- the internal nodes are the closure operations allowed in {prf:ref}`def-modal-profile-rigorous`;
- the denotation of the whole tree is extensionally equal to $\mathcal A$.

In Part IV, the phrases modal profile and modal factorization tree are used interchangeably.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Witness Decomposition

Every internally polynomial-time uniform family

admits a finite modal factorization tree whose leaves are pure

$$
\sharp,\ \int,\ \flat,\ \ast,\ \partial
$$
witnesses and whose internal nodes are the closure operations of
{prf:ref}`def-saturated-modal-closure-rigorous`.

Equivalently: every member of $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ can be expressed, up to extensional equality, by a finite composition
of pure modal witnesses together with presentation translators, finite products, bounded iteration, and finite
well-founded recursion.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Let $\mathcal A\in P_{\mathrm{FM}}(\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y;\sigma)$. By {prf:ref}`thm-syntax-to-normal-form`, there
exists a normal-form family

$$
F\in\mathsf{NF}
$$
such that

$$
F\equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} \mathcal A.
$$

Traverse the syntax tree of $F$ inductively.

1. Primitive leaves.
   - If a primitive leaf is administrative, absorb it into the administrative skeleton of the factorization tree:
     when it is extensionally a presentation translator, record it as a translator-conjugation node; otherwise treat
     it as the structural bookkeeping attached to the relevant product/sum/branch constructor, exactly as in the proof
     of {prf:ref}`thm-modal-profile-closure`.
   - If it is progress-producing, apply {prf:ref}`lem-primitive-step-classification` to replace it by a pure modal
     leaf.

2. Internal constructor nodes.
   Each internal constructor of the normal form is one of:
   - composition,
   - finite product or tagged sum/case analysis,
   - bounded iteration,
   - finite well-founded recursion,
   - or translator conjugation.

   By {prf:ref}`thm-modal-profile-closure`, together with the standard tagged-encoding treatment of sums/case analysis
   explained in its proof, the denotation of any tree obtained by combining already-classified child subtrees through
   one of these constructors remains inside

   $$
   \mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle.
   $$

3. Finiteness.
   The normal-form syntax tree is finite. Recursion nodes are represented as finite witness nodes carrying polynomial
   size/depth certificates; they are not literally unrolled into exponentially large trees.

Proceeding inductively from the leaves to the root yields a finite modal factorization tree $T$ with

$$
\llbracket T\rrbracket \equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} F \equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} \mathcal A.
$$

Therefore $\mathcal A$ admits a finite modal factorization tree.
:::

:::{prf:definition} The category of polynomial-time progress witnesses
:label: def-witpoly-category

The category

$$

1. Objects.
   An object is an extensional equivalence class

   $$
   [\mathcal A]
   $$
   of a uniform family

   $$
   \mathcal A:\mathfrak X\Rightarrow_{\sigma}\mathfrak Y
   $$
   such that:
   - $\mathcal A\in P_{\mathrm{FM}}(\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y;\sigma)$, and
   - $\mathcal A$ is not extensionally equivalent to a mere presentation translator.

   Thus $\mathsf{Wit}_{\mathrm{poly}}$ records genuine polynomial-time computational content, not purely
   administrative re-encodings.

2. Morphisms.
   A morphism

   $$
   [\mathcal A]\to[\mathcal B]
   $$
   is an equivalence class of pairs of presentation translators

   $$
   (P,Q)
   $$
   of compatible source and target types such that

   $$
   \mathcal B \equiv_{\mathrm{ext}} Q\circ \mathcal A \circ P.
   $$

3. Composition.
   Composition is induced by composition of presentation translators:

   $$
   (P_2,Q_2)\circ(P_1,Q_1) := (P_1\circ P_2,\ Q_2\circ Q_1),
   $$
   whenever the source/target families match.

4. Identities.
   Identity morphisms are given by identity presentation translators.

For each

$$
\lozenge\in\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\},
$$
let

$$
\mathsf W_\lozenge \subseteq \mathsf{Wit}_{\mathrm{poly}}
$$
denote the full subcategory on those objects admitting a pure $\lozenge$-witness.

:::{prf:remark} Why presentation translators become morphisms

The category {prf:ref}`def-witpoly-category` deliberately treats presentation translators as morphisms rather than as
objects of computational content. This is exactly what prevents administrative encoding choices from masquerading as new
algorithmic mechanisms.

Accordingly, the irreducibility notion below is irreducibility modulo presentation.

:label: def-witness-rank

Let $T$ be a modal factorization tree.

Define:
1. the pure-leaf count

   \lambda(T)

   to be the number of pure modal leaves of $T$;

2. the nontrivial closure count

   $$
   \kappa(T)
   $$
   to be the number of internal nodes of the following types:
   - composition,
   - finite product / tagged branch combination,
   - bounded iteration,
   - finite well-founded recursion.

Translator-conjugation nodes are not counted in $\kappa(T)$.

The rank of $T$ is the lexicographically ordered pair

$$
\mathrm{rk}(T):=(\lambda(T),\kappa(T)) \in \mathbb N_{>0}\times \mathbb N.
$$

If $[\mathcal A]\in \mathsf{Wit}_{\mathrm{poly}}$, define the witness rank of $[\mathcal A]$ to be

$$
\mathrm{rk}([\mathcal A])
:=
\min_{\text{$T$ a modal factorization tree for }\mathcal A}\mathrm{rk}(T),
$$
where the minimum is taken in lexicographic order.

This minimum exists because {prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition` supplies at least one finite modal factorization tree
for $\mathcal A$, and the lexicographic order on $\mathbb N_{>0}\times \mathbb N$ is well-founded.

rank

$$
\mathrm{rk}(T)=\mathrm{rk}([\mathcal A]),
$$
such that the root of $T$ is a nontrivial closure node, and the immediate child subtrees

$$
T_1,\dots,T_r

$$
[\mathcal B_1],\dots,[\mathcal B_r]\in\mathsf{Wit}_{\mathrm{poly}}
$$
satisfying

$$
\mathrm{rk}([\mathcal B_i]) < \mathrm{rk}([\mathcal A])
\qquad\text{for each }i.

If no such decomposition exists, then $[\mathcal A]$ is called irreducible.

In words: an irreducible witness object is one whose computational content cannot be expressed, up to presentation

is irreducible, then $\mathcal A$ admits a modal factorization tree whose minimal-rank representative consists of a
single pure modal leaf, together with at most translator-conjugation nodes.

This is the theorem that formalizes the statement that there is no hidden sixth computational mechanism. It is strictly
stronger than the set-theoretic equality

$$
P_{\mathrm{FM}}=\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle,
$$
because it classifies the irreducible generators of polynomial-time computation.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Let

$$
[\mathcal A]\in \mathsf{Wit}_{\mathrm{poly}}
$$
be irreducible. By {prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`, choose a modal factorization tree $T$ for $\mathcal A$ whose
rank is minimal:

$$
\mathrm{rk}(T)=\mathrm{rk}([\mathcal A])=(\lambda,\kappa).
$$

We show that necessarily

$$
(\lambda,\kappa)=(1,0).
$$

Step 1: $\kappa=0$.

Assume toward contradiction that $\kappa>0$. Then $T$ contains at least one nontrivial closure node. Choose one that
is highest in the tree, i.e. closest to the root among all such nodes. Let its immediate child subtrees be

$$
T_1,\dots,T_r.
$$

Each $T_i$ is a proper subtree of $T$, hence has strictly smaller rank than $T$ in the lexicographic order: either it
has fewer pure leaves, or the same number of pure leaves and fewer nontrivial closure nodes. Therefore each denoted
object

$$
[\mathcal B_i]:=[\llbracket T_i\rrbracket]
$$
satisfies

$$
\mathrm{rk}([\mathcal B_i])<\mathrm{rk}([\mathcal A]).
$$

But the chosen node expresses $[\mathcal A]$ as a nontrivial closure-combination of the $[\mathcal B_i]$,
contradicting irreducibility as defined in {prf:ref}`def-reducible-irreducible-witness`. Hence $\kappa=0$.

Step 2: $\lambda=1$.

Since $\kappa=0$, the tree $T$ contains no composition, product, bounded-iteration, or recursion node. The only
remaining internal nodes are translator-conjugation nodes. Such nodes do not create multiple independent computational
branches; they only precompose and postcompose a child subtree with presentation translators.

If $\lambda>1$, then the tree would necessarily require some nontrivial closure node to combine its multiple pure
leaves into a single denotation. But we have already proved that no such node exists. Therefore $\lambda=1$.

Step 3: identify the unique leaf.

So $T$ consists of exactly one pure leaf, possibly wrapped by translator-conjugation nodes. By the leaf rule in
{prf:ref}`def-modal-profile-rigorous`, that unique leaf is a pure witness of exactly one of

$$
\sharp,\ \int,\ \flat,\ \ast,\ \partial.
$$

Hence

$$
[\mathcal A]\in \mathsf W_\lozenge
$$
for some

$$
\lozenge\in\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\}.
$$

This proves the theorem.

:::{prf:remark} Why Theorem \ref{thm-irreducible-witness-classification} is the real “no hidden mechanism” theorem
:label: rem-why-thm21-is-real-no-hidden-mechanism

Corollary {prf:ref}`cor-computational-modal-exhaustiveness` below says that every polynomial-time computation belongs
to the saturated closure of the five classes. That already gives extensional exhaustiveness.

But Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-irreducible-witness-classification` is stronger: it says that even after quotienting out all
mere presentation changes, every irreducible generator of polynomial-time computation lies in one of the five pure
classes. This is exactly the formal content required to rule out a genuine Class VI mechanism.

We prove both inclusions.

Inclusion $\subseteq$.
Let

$$
\mathcal A\in P_{\mathrm{FM}}(\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y;\sigma).

By {prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`, $\mathcal A$ admits a finite modal factorization tree. By definition of
saturated modal closure in {prf:ref}`def-saturated-modal-closure-rigorous`, this implies

$$
\mathcal A\in \mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle.
$$

Inclusion $\supseteq$.
Conversely, let

$$
\mathcal A\in \mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle.
$$
By {prf:ref}`thm-modal-composition`, every finite modal profile built from pure witnesses computes an internally
polynomial-time family. Therefore

$$
\mathcal A\in P_{\mathrm{FM}}.
$$

Combining the two inclusions yields the claimed equality.

Part IV proves computational modal exhaustiveness:

$$

Part V turns this into a **problem-level hardness mechanism** via the mixed-modal obstruction theorem
({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`): if all five semantic obstruction propositions hold for a problem family
$\Pi$, then $\Pi \notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}$.

**What the P$\neq$NP proof requires.** Only two things:

1. The mixed-modal obstruction theorem (proved below from {prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition` and
   {prf:ref}`thm-irreducible-witness-classification`).
2. Five problem-specific semantic obstructions $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}})$ for canonical 3-SAT
   (established in Part VI via the blockage lemmas).

**What the P$\neq$NP proof does NOT require.** General-purpose obstruction calculi, completeness theorems for
arbitrary problem families, and universality characterizations are optional infrastructure for extending the
framework to other problems. They are not in the critical path.

:::{prf:definition} Modal Barrier Decomposition
:label: def-modal-barrier-decomposition

A translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak{B} = (\mathfrak{Z}, i, \mathfrak{H}, S, r, E, a, b)$ admits a **modal barrier decomposition** if there exist five energy component functions

$$E_\sharp, E_\int, E_\flat, E_\ast, E_\partial : \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$$

defined on the algorithm's extended configuration space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} = \prod_{\lozenge} Z_n^\lozenge$ (the categorical product of the five modal workspaces), together with corresponding thresholds $a_\lozenge, b_\lozenge : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, satisfying:

1. **Workspace alignment:** Each $E_\lozenge(\tilde{z})$ depends only on the $\lozenge$-workspace component $\tilde{z}_\lozenge \in Z_n^\lozenge$ of the extended state $\tilde{z} \in \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$. That is, there exist functions $\hat{E}_\lozenge : Z_n^\lozenge \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that $E_\lozenge(\tilde{z}) = \hat{E}_\lozenge(\tilde{z}_\lozenge)$.

2. **Modal orthogonality:** For each $\lozenge$ and any barrier-compatible pure $\lozenge$-endomorphism $F^\lozenge$ with encoding $E^\lozenge$ and reconstruction $R^\lozenge$, the **transported endomorphism** $F^\lozenge_* := R^\lozenge \circ F^\lozenge \circ E^\lozenge$ (the full composite acting on the global state $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$) preserves non-$\lozenge$ energy components:

   $$E_{\lozenge'}(F^\lozenge_*(\tilde{z})) = E_{\lozenge'}(\tilde{z}) \qquad \text{for all } \lozenge' \neq \lozenge$$

   **Clarification on the product structure.** The extended configuration space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$ is a **proof device** for tracking energy contributions, not a claim about the algorithm's physical memory layout. The actual algorithm operates on a shared tape $\{0,1\}^{O(p(n))}$. The product space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$ arises from the encoding maps $E^\lozenge$, which project the shared tape state onto modal workspaces, and the reconstruction maps $R^\lozenge$, which embed modal outputs back. Orthogonality is a property of these encoding/reconstruction-mediated *energy changes*, not of disjoint memory regions. See {prf:ref}`rem-workspace-separation-shared-state` for the full argument.

3. **Initial and terminal bounds:** For each modality $\lozenge$, the energy component satisfies $E_\lozenge(\tilde{z}_{\mathrm{start}}) \leq a_\lozenge(n)$ at the initial state and $E_\lozenge(\tilde{z}_{\mathrm{solved}}) \leq a_\lozenge(n)$ at any solved state.

4. **Independent sub-barrier crossing:** For every path from a hard input state to a solved state in the state graph of the problem, and for each modality $\lozenge$, there exists a state along the path where $E_\lozenge \geq b_\lozenge(n)$. That is, each modal sub-barrier must be individually crossed.

5. **Translator stability of components:** Each $E_\lozenge$ is translator-stable: for every presentation translator $T$, the transported component $E_\lozenge \circ T^{-1}$ remains a valid $\lozenge$-barrier component (with polynomially distorted thresholds).
:::

:::{prf:remark} Additivity is not required
:label: rem-additivity-not-required

The definition above deliberately weakens the original formulation in two respects:

1. **Property 1 (workspace alignment) replaces additive decomposition.** The earlier requirement $E(z) = E_\sharp(z) + E_\int(z) + E_\flat(z) + E_\ast(z) + E_\partial(z)$ asserted that the total barrier energy is the sum of five components on the *shared* state space $\{0,1\}^n$. This is untenable: any single variable flip in a 3-SAT assignment simultaneously affects clause satisfaction (the $\sharp$-landscape), dependency structure (the $\int$-poset), algebraic relations (the $\flat$-ring), recursion-tree load (the $\ast$-partition), and interface complexity (the $\partial$-boundary). True additivity on $\{0,1\}^n$ is impossible precisely because these structural properties are coupled on the shared state space. Orthogonality can only arise from *workspace separation* — each modality operating on its own workspace $Z_n^\lozenge$ within the extended configuration space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$.

2. **Property 3 (initial/terminal bounds) replaces threshold sums.** The earlier constraint $\sum_\lozenge a_\lozenge = a$ and $\sum_\lozenge b_\lozenge = b$ imposed an exact decomposition of global thresholds. The weakened property requires only that each component is individually bounded at start and end states — a condition that follows directly from the workspace-projected construction.

**These weakenings lose nothing.** The proof of {prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification` — the sole downstream consumer of the barrier decomposition — cites only Property 2 (modal orthogonality, used in Parts I and II) and Property 4 (independent sub-barrier crossing, used in Part III). It never invokes additive decomposition or threshold sums. The weakened workspace-aligned formulation is strictly sufficient for all downstream results.

:::{prf:definition} Explicit 3-SAT Modal Energy Components

For any algorithm $\mathcal{A} \in P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ with factorization tree $T$, each pure $\lozenge$-leaf operates in its modal workspace $Z_n^\lozenge$. The extended configuration space is $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}_n = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$, and each energy component $E_\lozenge$ is the canonical progress measure on the $\lozenge$-workspace:

| Component | Workspace progress measure | Initial bound | Solved value | Per-step change | Source |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| $E_\sharp(\tilde{z})$ | Ranking function $V_\sharp(\tilde{z}_\sharp)$ on the $\sharp$-workspace | $\leq q_\sharp(n)$ | $0$ | $\leq 1$ (strict descent) | {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous` item 5 |
| $E_\int(\tilde{z})$ | Unprocessed poset levels: $h(P_n) - (\text{levels completed in } \tilde{z}_\int)$ | $h(P_n) \leq q_\int(n)$ | $0$ | $\leq 1$ (one level per step) | {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous` items 3, 8 |
| $E_\flat(\tilde{z})$ | Uneliminated variables in the $\flat$-workspace | $n$ | $0$ | $\leq 1$ (one elimination per step) | {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous` |
| $E_\ast(\tilde{z})$ | Recursion-tree residual load: total unprocessed nodes in $\tilde{z}_\ast$ | $\leq q_\ast(n)$ | $0$ | $\leq 1$ (one node per step) | {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous` |
| $E_\partial(\tilde{z})$ | Interface residual: unresolved interface variables in $\tilde{z}_\partial$ | $\leq q_\partial(n)$ | $0$ | $O(1)$ | {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous` |

Each $E_\lozenge$ is defined on the $\lozenge$-workspace $Z_n^\lozenge$, not on the shared state space $\{0,1\}^n$. The workspace-alignment property (Property 1 of {prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition`) holds by construction: $E_\lozenge(\tilde{z}) = \hat{E}_\lozenge(\tilde{z}_\lozenge)$. Orthogonality (Property 2) follows automatically: a non-$\lozenge$ step operates in a different workspace and does not modify $\tilde{z}_\lozenge$.

The canonical 3-SAT barrier datum $\mathfrak{B}_{3\text{-SAT}}$ of {prf:ref}`def-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum` admits a modal barrier decomposition in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition`, with sub-barrier heights:

| Component | Captures | Sub-barrier height | Blockage reference |

| $E_\partial$ | Boundary contraction difficulty (treewidth) | $\Delta_\partial(n) = \Omega(n)$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage` |

*Proof.*

**Step 1. [Workspace-projected energy components]:**
For any $\mathcal{A} \in P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ with factorization tree $T$, define the five energy components $E_\sharp, E_\int, E_\flat, E_\ast, E_\partial$ as in {prf:ref}`def-explicit-3sat-modal-energies`. Each $E_\lozenge(\tilde{z}) = \hat{E}_\lozenge(\tilde{z}_\lozenge)$ depends only on the $\lozenge$-workspace state $\tilde{z}_\lozenge \in Z_n^\lozenge$, satisfying Property 1 (workspace alignment) of {prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition`.

**Step 2. [Orthogonality via workspace separation]:**
Fix modalities $\lozenge \neq \lozenge'$. A transported pure $\lozenge'$-endomorphism $R^{\lozenge'} \circ F^{\lozenge'} \circ E^{\lozenge'}$ modifies the extended configuration $\tilde{z}$ only within the $\lozenge'$-workspace: the encoding $E^{\lozenge'}$ reads $\tilde{z}$ into $Z_n^{\lozenge'}$, the core map $F^{\lozenge'}$ transforms within $Z_n^{\lozenge'}$, and the reconstruction $R^{\lozenge'}$ writes back to $\tilde{z}_{\lozenge'}$. The component $\tilde{z}_\lozenge$ is unchanged because $R^{\lozenge'}$ writes only to the $\lozenge'$-component of $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}_n = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$. Therefore $E_\lozenge(\tilde{z}') = \hat{E}_\lozenge(\tilde{z}'_\lozenge) = \hat{E}_\lozenge(\tilde{z}_\lozenge) = E_\lozenge(\tilde{z})$, establishing Property 2.

This is not merely an assertion but follows from the type-theoretic structure of the factorization tree ({prf:ref}`def-modal-factorization-tree`): each leaf's encoding/reconstruction pair $(E^\lozenge, R^\lozenge)$ acts on $Z_n^\lozenge \hookrightarrow \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}_n$, and the inclusion is into a different factor than $Z_n^{\lozenge'} \hookrightarrow \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}_n$. The categorical product structure of $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}_n$ ensures the components are independent.

**Step 3. [Independent crossing via blockage lemmas]:**
For each $\lozenge$, the corresponding blockage lemma establishes that $E_\lozenge$ must change by $\Omega(n)$ on any solving path:

- **$\sharp$-channel:** The ranking function $V_\sharp$ starts at $\leq q_\sharp(n)$ and must reach $0$. By {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-metric-blockage`, the shattered landscape imposes an $\Omega(n)$ barrier: the ranking function must pass through values $\geq c_\sharp \cdot n$ during any descent (otherwise the metric profile cannot distinguish the $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters). Each $\sharp$-step decreases $V_\sharp$ by at most $1$, so the $\sharp$-trace must cross the sub-barrier.

- **$\int$-channel:** The poset height $h(P_n) = \Omega(n)$ for any valid $\int$-witness on the hard subfamily (frustrated cycles force depth $\Omega(n)$). Each $\int$-step processes one level. Every solving path must process all levels.

- **$\flat$-channel:** Algebraic elimination must process $\Omega(n)$ variables. Algebraic rigidity (frozen variables, propagation rigidity per {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage`) prevents shortcuts.

- **$\ast$-channel:** The recursion tree has load $\Omega(n \log n)$ by the $\Theta(n)$ separator cost at each level ({prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-scaling-blockage`). Every solving path must traverse the full recursion tree.

- **$\partial$-channel:** Interface complexity $\mathrm{tw}(G_n) = \Theta(n)$ ({prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage`). Every solving path must resolve $\Theta(n)$ interface variables.

Since each $E_\lozenge$ starts at $\leq a_\lozenge(n)$, reaches $0$ at the solved state, and must pass through values $\geq b_\lozenge(n) = \Omega(n)$ along any solving path, Property 4 (independent sub-barrier crossing) holds.

**Step 4. [Translator stability]:**
Each $E_\lozenge$ is defined on the $\lozenge$-workspace $Z_n^\lozenge$. By {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`, presentation translators $T$ induce transported energy components $E_\lozenge \circ T^{-1}$ with polynomially distorted thresholds, preserving the $\Omega(n)$ sub-barrier. Property 5 holds. $\square$

:::{prf:remark} Justification of modal orthogonality
:label: rem-modal-orthogonality-justification

The orthogonality established in Step 2 of {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-modal-barrier-decomposition`
follows from the type-theoretic separation enforced by the pure witness definitions. By
{prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract`, each pure $\lozenge$-witness operates on its own modal
workspace $\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$ via the encoding $E_n^\lozenge$ and reconstruction $R_n^\lozenge$.
The core map $F_n^\lozenge$ is an endomorphism of $\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$ — it maps
$Z_n^\lozenge$ to $Z_n^\lozenge$ without accessing state components outside $\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$.

In the factorization tree of {prf:ref}`def-modal-factorization-tree`, each leaf operates within its
designated modal workspace. The encoding maps the global state INTO the workspace; the reconstruction
maps it BACK. Between encoding and reconstruction, the core map sees only the $\lozenge$-component.
This structural separation guarantees that a pure $\sharp$-step does not modify the dependency
structure ($\int$-component), algebraic presentations ($\flat$-component), recursion-tree structure
($\ast$-component), or interface objects ($\partial$-component).

The workspace-projected construction of {prf:ref}`def-explicit-3sat-modal-energies` makes this mechanism
fully explicit: because $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}_n = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$ is a categorical product
and each reconstruction map $R^\lozenge$ writes only to the $\lozenge$-factor, the projection
$\pi_{\lozenge'} : \tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}_n \to Z_n^{\lozenge'}$ commutes with non-$\lozenge'$ transported
endomorphisms. Orthogonality is thus a consequence of the product structure, not an independent axiom
requiring verification.

:::{prf:remark} Role of the barrier decomposition in the main proof
:label: rem-barrier-decomposition-supporting

The barrier decomposition of {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-modal-barrier-decomposition` provides
**quantitative infrastructure** supporting {prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification`. It is important
to situate this infrastructure relative to the main $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$ argument:

1. **Role on the critical path.** The principal $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$ result routes
   through {prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`, which requires the five semantic obstruction
   propositions $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi)$. Establishing these from the five blockage lemmas
   of Part VI requires the **transfer theorem**
   ({prf:ref}`thm-modal-barrier-obstruction-transfer`), which uses the barrier decomposition:
   the transfer theorem shows that any irreducible $\lozenge$-component in a correct solver
   would need to cross the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier, which the blockage lemma forbids. The
   barrier decomposition therefore enters the critical path through
   {prf:ref}`prop-six-certificates-cover-five-channels`. Note, however, that the structural
   blockage arguments (pigeonhole for $\sharp$, frustrated cycles for $\int$, etc.) are the
   primary exclusion mechanism; the barrier decomposition provides the formal bridge from
   "no pure $\lozenge$-witness solves $\Pi$" to "no correct solver contains an irreducible
   $\lozenge$-component."

2. **Quantitative strengthening.** Beyond its role in the transfer theorem, the barrier
   decomposition provides an independent quantitative framework for understanding *why* the
   five blockages compose: each represents an independent energy sub-barrier in a separate
   workspace, and the workspace-product structure ensures that progress in one channel cannot
   subsidize another. This is the content of the non-amplification principle
   ({prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification`).

3. **Architectural role.** The decomposition connects the step-level witness decomposition
   ({prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`) to the problem-level blockages: it shows that the
   per-step modal constraints aggregate into per-channel energy budgets, each of which is
   independently exhausted by the corresponding blockage lemma.

:::{prf:theorem} Modal Non-Amplification Principle
:label: thm-modal-non-amplification

Let $\Pi$ be a problem family whose barrier datum $\mathfrak{B}$ admits a modal barrier
decomposition ({prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition`) with energy components
$E_\sharp, E_\int, E_\flat, E_\ast, E_\partial$ and sub-barrier heights
$\Delta_\lozenge(n) := b_\lozenge(n) - a_\lozenge(n)$.

Let $\mathcal{A} \in P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ be a polynomial-time algorithm with factorization tree $T$
of total size $|T| \leq p(n)$. By linearising $T$ — executing product children in any fixed
order, unrolling bounded-iteration nodes into their (polynomial-many) repetitions, and expanding
well-founded-recursion nodes into their finite call trees — the computation of $\mathcal{A}$ on
input $x$ produces a state trace

$$
z_0(x) \xrightarrow{L_1} z_1(x) \xrightarrow{L_2} z_2(x) \xrightarrow{L_3} \cdots
\xrightarrow{L_t} z_t(x)
$$

where each step $L_j$ is a **transported pure $\lozenge_j$-modal endomorphism** — the composite
$R_j^{\lozenge_j} \circ F_j^{\lozenge_j} \circ E_j^{\lozenge_j}$ acting on the global state
$z_{j-1}$ via the leaf's encoding $E_j^{\lozenge_j}$, core map $F_j^{\lozenge_j}$, and
reconstruction $R_j^{\lozenge_j}$ — and $t \leq p(n)$. Let $N_\lozenge$ denote the number of
$\lozenge$-type steps in the trace.

Then:

**Part I (Channel Isolation).** For each modality $\lozenge$ and each computation path, the
total change in the $\lozenge$-energy component is due exclusively to $\lozenge$-type steps:

$$
E_\lozenge(z_t) - E_\lozenge(z_0)
= \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\[2pt] \lozenge_j = \lozenge}}^{t}
  \bigl[E_\lozenge(z_j) - E_\lozenge(z_{j-1})\bigr].
$$

All terms with $\lozenge_j \neq \lozenge$ contribute zero. Non-$\lozenge$ computation is
**transparent** to the $\lozenge$-energy channel.

**Part II (State-Equivalence Persistence).** Define inputs $x_1, x_2$ as
**$\lozenge$-equivalent at step $i$** if $E_\lozenge(z_i(x_1)) = E_\lozenge(z_i(x_2))$.

(a) $\lozenge$-equivalence is preserved by non-$\lozenge$ steps: if $x_1, x_2$ are
    $\lozenge$-equivalent at step $i$ and $L_{i+1}$ has type $\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$, then
    $x_1, x_2$ remain $\lozenge$-equivalent at step $i+1$.

(b) $\lozenge$-equivalence can only be refined (split into finer classes) by $\lozenge$-type
    steps. All non-$\lozenge$ steps, regardless of their computational power, are invisible to
    the $\lozenge$-equivalence relation.

**Part III (Minimum-Channel Bottleneck).** For each $\lozenge$, define the total
$\lozenge$-variation along a computation path:

$$
\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge
:= \sum_{\substack{j=1\\[2pt]\lozenge_j=\lozenge}}^t
  \bigl|E_\lozenge(z_j) - E_\lozenge(z_{j-1})\bigr|.
$$

Define the **per-step $\lozenge$-capacity**:

$$
\delta_\lozenge(n)
:= \sup_z\;\sup_{L \text{ pure $\lozenge$-leaf}}
  \bigl|E_\lozenge\bigl((R^{\lozenge}_L \circ F^{\lozenge}_L \circ E^{\lozenge}_L)(z)\bigr)
  - E_\lozenge(z)\bigr|,
$$

where the suprema range over all global states $z \in Z_n$ and all transported pure
$\lozenge$-endomorphisms appearing as leaves in any polynomial-time factorization tree. By
Part I, only $\lozenge$-type steps contribute to $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge$, so:

$$
\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge \leq N_\lozenge \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n) \leq p(n) \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n).
$$

Crossing the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier requires $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge \geq \Delta_\lozenge(n)$
(the path must rise from $\leq a_\lozenge$ through $\geq b_\lozenge$ and return to
$\leq a_\lozenge$). Therefore: **if**

$$
\Delta_\lozenge(n) > p(n) \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n)
\quad\text{for every polynomial } p,
$$

then no polynomial-time algorithm can cross the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier. The condition
$\Delta_\lozenge(n) > p(n) \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n)$ for all $p$ is a **per-channel proof
obligation** discharged by the individual blockage lemmas of Part VI (see
{prf:ref}`rem-per-step-bounds-from-blockage`).

**Part IV (Independence Across Channels).** The five channels evolve independently:

1. Increasing the number of non-$\lozenge$ leaves does not increase $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge$.
2. $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge$ depends only on the $E_\lozenge$-values encountered at
   $\lozenge$-type steps. By Part I, these $E_\lozenge$-values are unchanged by intervening
   non-$\lozenge$ steps, so the $\lozenge$-energy trace is the same as it would be if
   non-$\lozenge$ steps were absent.
3. The solver must cross all five sub-barriers. If any single channel is blocked, the solver
   fails — the remaining four channels, however powerful, cannot subsidize the blocked channel.

Therefore: combining five orthogonal modal channels, each individually insufficient, produces a
composite that is also insufficient. Inter-modal composition provides **zero cross-channel
amplification**.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 0 (Linearisation).**
A factorization tree $T$ is a finite tree whose leaves are pure modal witnesses and whose
internal nodes are closure operations (composition, finite product, bounded iteration, finite
well-founded recursion, translator conjugation). Any execution of $T$ on input $x$ visits each
leaf at most once per iteration/recursion unrolling. Since the iteration bound and recursion
depth are both polynomial, the total number of leaf visits is $t \leq p(n)$. Fixing a
deterministic scheduling of product children and unrolling iteration/recursion yields a unique
state trace $z_0, z_1, \ldots, z_t$ where each transition $z_{j-1} \to z_j$ corresponds to a
single leaf visit. The energy accounting below depends only on which leaf (and hence which
modality) is applied at each step, not on the particular scheduling order, because each step's
energy contribution is determined by property 2 of the barrier decomposition.

**Part I.**
Fix a modality $\lozenge$ and a computation step $j$ with $\lozenge_j \neq \lozenge$. Step
$L_j$ acts on the global state as the transported endomorphism
$F^{\lozenge_j}_{*} = R_j^{\lozenge_j} \circ F_j^{\lozenge_j} \circ E_j^{\lozenge_j}$.
By the $\lozenge_j$-supportedness property of {prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract`,
$F^{\lozenge_j}_{*}$ is invisible to all $\lozenge$-modal observations (for
$\lozenge \neq \lozenge_j$). In particular, the $\lozenge$-energy function $E_\lozenge$ is
$\lozenge$-modal (it factors through the $\lozenge$-encoding), so
$E_\lozenge \circ F^{\lozenge_j}_{*} = E_\lozenge$, giving zero energy change.
This is precisely property 2 of
{prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition` (modal orthogonality) instantiated at the witness level:

$$
E_\lozenge(z_j)
= E_\lozenge\bigl(F^{\lozenge_j}_{*}(z_{j-1})\bigr)
= E_\lozenge(z_{j-1}).
$$

Hence $E_\lozenge(z_j) - E_\lozenge(z_{j-1}) = 0$ for every step with $\lozenge_j \neq \lozenge$.
Telescoping:

$$
E_\lozenge(z_t) - E_\lozenge(z_0)
= \sum_{j=1}^{t}\bigl[E_\lozenge(z_j) - E_\lozenge(z_{j-1})\bigr]
= \sum_{\substack{j=1\\[2pt]\lozenge_j = \lozenge}}^{t}
  \bigl[E_\lozenge(z_j) - E_\lozenge(z_{j-1})\bigr].
$$

**Part II(a).**
If $E_\lozenge(z_i(x_1)) = E_\lozenge(z_i(x_2))$ and $L_{i+1}$ has type
$\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$, then by Part I applied to step $i+1$:

$$
E_\lozenge(z_{i+1}(x_k)) = E_\lozenge(z_i(x_k)) \quad \text{for } k \in \{1,2\}.
$$

Hence $E_\lozenge(z_{i+1}(x_1)) = E_\lozenge(z_{i+1}(x_2))$: $\lozenge$-equivalence persists.

**Part II(b).**
Immediate from Part II(a): the only steps that can alter $E_\lozenge$ values — and thereby
split a $\lozenge$-equivalence class — are $\lozenge$-type steps.

**Part III.**
By property 4 of {prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition` (independent sub-barrier crossing),
every computation path from a hard input state to a solved state must pass through a state
where $E_\lozenge \geq b_\lozenge(n)$ for each $\lozenge$. The path starts with
$E_\lozenge \leq a_\lozenge(n) + o(1)$ and must end with $E_\lozenge \leq a_\lozenge(n)$
(solved). Therefore $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge \geq \Delta_\lozenge(n)$.

By Part I, only $\lozenge$-type steps contribute to $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge$. Each contributes
at most $\delta_\lozenge(n)$ by definition. There are $N_\lozenge \leq p(n)$ such steps, giving
$\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge \leq p(n) \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n)$.

If $\Delta_\lozenge(n) > p(n) \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n)$ for every polynomial $p$, the required
variation exceeds the available budget and the solver cannot cross the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier.

**Part IV.**
By Part I, the five energy traces $(E_\sharp(z_j))_j, (E_\int(z_j))_j, \ldots$ are
decoupled: each evolves according to its matching leaves alone. For Part IV.2: at each
$\lozenge$-step $j$, the $E_\lozenge$-value $E_\lozenge(z_{j-1})$ is the same as it would be
without the intervening non-$\lozenge$ steps (because those steps leave $E_\lozenge$ invariant
by Part I). Therefore $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge$ computed from the full trace equals
$\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge$ computed from the $\lozenge$-only subtrace. Each sub-barrier must be
individually crossed. If any single channel's variation budget is insufficient, the solver fails
— regardless of the other four channels' capacities. $\square$
:::

:::{prf:remark} Workspace separation and shared algorithmic state
:label: rem-workspace-separation-shared-state

The modal barrier decomposition ({prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition`) and the
non-amplification principle ({prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification`) refer to modal workspaces
$Z_n^\lozenge$ and an extended configuration space
$\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$. A natural objection is that an actual
Turing machine has a **single shared tape** — the state space is
$\{0,1\}^{O(p(n))}$, not a product of five disjoint workspaces. Every step can read and write
every bit of the tape; a reconstruction map $R^\sharp$ could write bits that $E^\int$ later
reads, creating an apparent cross-modal information pathway. This remark addresses the objection
in four parts.

**1. The factorization tree is a specification, not an execution model; the per-step bound is a
local property of modal type.**
The pure witness definition ({prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract`) requires the *existence*
of encoding/reconstruction maps $E^\lozenge, R^\lozenge$ such that the algorithm's input-output
behavior at each leaf factors as $R^\lozenge \circ F^\lozenge \circ E^\lozenge$. This
factorization constrains the **input-output behavior** of each leaf, not the intermediate tape
states during its execution. The algorithm's actual computation may touch any tape cell; what
matters is that the net effect on the global state decomposes through the modal workspace.

The per-step capacity bound $\delta_\lozenge(n)$ — defined in Part III of
{prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification` as
$\delta_\lozenge(n) := \sup_z \sup_{L} |E_\lozenge((R^\lozenge_L \circ F^\lozenge_L \circ
E^\lozenge_L)(z)) - E_\lozenge(z)|$ — is a **per-step local property**. It measures how much
$\lozenge$-energy progress a single step of modal type $\lozenge$ can achieve. This bound
depends on two things: (i) the modal type of the step (what kind of operation it performs) and
(ii) the current state $z$. It does **not** depend on the global memory architecture — whether
the algorithm runs on one tape, five tapes, or a random-access machine, the factorization
$R^\lozenge \circ F^\lozenge \circ E^\lozenge$ constrains the same input-output behavior, and
therefore the same per-step energy change bound applies. The product decomposition
$\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$ is the *analysis framework* for tracking
these per-step contributions; the non-amplification theorem then *aggregates* the per-step
bounds into the channel budget $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge \leq N_\lozenge \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n)$.

**2. Channel isolation follows from the $\lozenge$-supportedness axiom and the factorization requirement, not from physical workspace
separation.**
The $\lozenge$-supportedness property in {prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract` — requiring
$q \circ F^{\lozenge}_* = q$ for every $\lozenge'$-modal map $q$ with
$\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$ — is what justifies Channel Isolation on the shared tape. On the product
space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$, $\lozenge$-supportedness is trivially visible
because different channels occupy different factors. But on a shared tape the property is a genuine
constraint on the witness: the transported endomorphism $F^{\lozenge}_*$ must be invisible to all
other channels' modal observations. The $\lozenge$-supportedness axiom makes this constraint explicit in the
definition of a pure witness, rather than relying on the product-space visualization alone.
The energy $E_\lozenge$ is defined as a function of the $\lozenge$-workspace state:
$E_\lozenge(\tilde{z}) = \hat{E}_\lozenge(\tilde{z}_\lozenge)$, where
$\tilde{z}_\lozenge = \pi_\lozenge(\tilde{z})$ is the projection onto the $\lozenge$-factor.
A transported pure $\lozenge'$-endomorphism
$F^{\lozenge'}_* = R^{\lozenge'} \circ F^{\lozenge'} \circ E^{\lozenge'}$ acts on
$\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$ by modifying only the $\lozenge'$-component (this is the content of the
factorization requirement — $R^{\lozenge'}$ writes back to $Z_n^{\lozenge'}$, not to
$Z_n^\lozenge$ for $\lozenge \neq \lozenge'$). Therefore
$\hat{E}_\lozenge(\pi_\lozenge(F^{\lozenge'}_*(\tilde{z})))
= \hat{E}_\lozenge(\pi_\lozenge(\tilde{z}))$:
the $\lozenge$-energy is unchanged. The point is that $F^{\lozenge'}$ is a function of
$\mu^{\lozenge'}(z)$ (the $\lozenge'$-modal profile), so its output is constrained by that
profile even if the underlying computation reads additional tape cells.

To be precise about the logic: we are **not** claiming that the algorithm's physical memory is
partitioned. We are claiming that for each step $j$ with modal type $\lozenge_j$, the energy
change $|E_\lozenge(z_j) - E_\lozenge(z_{j-1})|$ is zero when $\lozenge \neq \lozenge_j$.
This is a statement about the *composition* $E_\lozenge \circ R^{\lozenge_j} \circ
F^{\lozenge_j} \circ E^{\lozenge_j}$: because $R^{\lozenge_j}$ writes to the
$\lozenge_j$-factor and $E_\lozenge$ reads from the $\lozenge$-factor, the composition
$E_\lozenge \circ R^{\lozenge_j}$ factors through the $\lozenge$-projection and is therefore
constant in the $\lozenge_j$-output. This is a purely algebraic property of the encoding and
reconstruction maps — it holds on the single shared tape just as well as on a product space,
because it is a statement about the *functions* $E^\lozenge$ and $R^{\lozenge'}$, not about
memory regions.

**3. Cross-modal information pathways via $R^\sharp \to E^\int$ are handled by the
reconstruction map constraints.**
The reconstruction map $R^\sharp$ is a presentation translator: its output is a valid encoding
for the next step. If $R^\sharp$ modifies the shared tape, $E^\int$ reads the new tape state.
But the non-amplification claim is **not** that $\sharp$-steps do not change the tape — it is
that a $\sharp$-step's **net contribution to the $\int$-energy change is zero**. This follows
because:

- The $\sharp$-step's core map $F^\sharp$ is determined by $\mu^\sharp(z)$ (the
  $\sharp$-modal profile).
- The $\int$-energy $E_\int$ is determined by the $\int$-encoding
  $E^\int(z)$, i.e., by the $\int$-workspace projection.
- By the modal restriction ({prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract`),
  $F^\sharp$ does not exploit $\int$-type structure.
- Therefore the $\sharp$-step's effect on $E_\int$ is mediated entirely by
  $R^\sharp$, which writes back only to $Z_n^\sharp$.
- Since $E_\int$ depends only on $\tilde{z}_\int$ and $R^\sharp$ does not modify
  $\tilde{z}_\int$, we have $E_\int(F^\sharp_*(\tilde{z})) = E_\int(\tilde{z})$.

The deeper point addresses the **cross-modal encoding preservation** concern directly. Suppose
a $\sharp$-step writes data $d$ to the shared tape via $R^\sharp$, and a subsequent $\int$-step
reads $d$ via $E^\int$. One might worry that $d$ carries $\sharp$-channel information that the
$\int$-step can exploit to gain extra $\int$-energy progress, violating the per-step bound
$\delta_\int(n)$. But this conflates *data availability* with *processing capacity*:

- The $\int$-step applies its core map $F^\int$ to $E^\int(z)$, the $\int$-modal encoding of
  the current tape state. The data $d$ is simply part of the tape that $E^\int$ reads — it
  becomes part of the $\int$-workspace state $\tilde{z}_\int$.
- The per-step bound $\delta_\int(n)$ is defined as
  $\sup_z |E_\int(R^\int \circ F^\int \circ E^\int(z)) - E_\int(z)|$, where the supremum
  ranges over **all** states $z$ — including states whose tape contains data written by prior
  $\sharp$-steps. The bound already accounts for the worst case over all possible tape contents.
- What the $\int$-step can *accomplish* with data $d$ is bounded by the $\int$-channel capacity
  $\delta_\int(n)$, regardless of the data's provenance. The $\int$-step processes $d$ through
  $\int$-modal operations ($E^\int$, $F^\int$, $R^\int$), and these operations' contribution
  to $\int$-energy is bounded by $\delta_\int(n)$ by definition.

In summary: cross-modal data flow via the shared tape is real, but it does not create
cross-modal *energy amplification*. The data written by one channel becomes input to another,
but the receiving channel's per-step energy progress is bounded by its own modal capacity, not
by the data's origin.

**4. The product space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}} = \prod_\lozenge Z_n^\lozenge$ is a proof device,
not a claim about the algorithm's memory layout.**
The product space is a mathematical construction for tracking the energy contributions of each
modality independently. The encoding maps $E^\lozenge : \{0,1\}^{O(p(n))} \to Z_n^\lozenge$
project the shared tape state onto each modal workspace; the reconstruction maps embed modal
outputs back. The product $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$ is the codomain of the joint encoding
$\tilde{E} = (E^\sharp, E^\int, E^\flat, E^\ast, E^\partial)$, which maps the actual tape state
to a tuple of modal workspace states. Energy accounting in $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$ is valid
because each $E_\lozenge$ depends only on its factor, and the factorization requirement
guarantees that each transported endomorphism modifies only its own factor. The algorithm's
memory is shared; the *analysis* is factored.

This is precisely what Property 2 (modal orthogonality) of
{prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition` encodes: the equation
$E_{\lozenge'}(F^\lozenge_*(\tilde{z})) = E_{\lozenge'}(\tilde{z})$ for
$\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$ is a statement about the **accounting framework**, not about hardware
separation. The product space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$ is the *ledger* in which we record each
channel's energy separately; Property 2 guarantees that the ledger's columns do not interfere.
The non-amplification theorem ({prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification`) then reads off the
per-column totals: each column's variation is bounded by
$N_\lozenge \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n) \leq p(n) \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n)$, and if any column's
required variation $\Delta_\lozenge(n)$ exceeds this budget, the algorithm fails — regardless of
what the other columns achieve.

To summarize: the non-amplification theorem is proved *about* the actual single-tape Turing
machine. The product space $\tilde{\mathfrak{Z}}$ is the proof's bookkeeping device for
decomposing the analysis into per-channel energy budgets. The per-step bounds
$\delta_\lozenge(n)$ are properties of individual steps' modal types, established on the actual
tape. The product structure organizes these bounds into channel-separated accounts. No step of
the argument requires or assumes that the algorithm's memory is physically partitioned.

:::{prf:remark} Why non-amplification resolves the step-level / problem-level gap
:label: rem-non-amplification-resolves-gap

{prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification` directly addresses the apparent gap between step-level
decomposition ({prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`) and problem-level blockage (the five
obstruction lemmas of Part VI):

1. **Step level.** Every polynomial-time algorithm decomposes into a factorization tree of
   pure modal leaves, each operating within its modal workspace. Individual leaves are small
   computational units, not problem-level solvers.

2. **Problem level.** Each blockage lemma establishes that solving the problem requires
   $\Delta_\lozenge(n) = \Omega(n)$ of $\lozenge$-energy variation.

3. **Bridge (non-amplification).** By channel isolation (Part I), the aggregate
   $\lozenge$-energy budget of a polynomial-time algorithm is

   $$\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge \leq N_\lozenge \cdot \delta_\lozenge(n) \leq p(n) \cdot
   \delta_\lozenge(n)$$

   and **nothing else**. Non-$\lozenge$ leaves — however numerous, however powerful — contribute
   zero to $\mathrm{Var}_\lozenge$.

This is the formal realization of the principle that **orthogonal information channels cannot
amplify each other**: combining five types of modal computation, each individually insufficient,
produces a composite that is also insufficient. The weakest channel determines the composite's
fate.

An analogy: five workers building a house, each responsible for a different trade (electrical,
plumbing, framing, roofing, finishing). If the electrical work requires 1000 hours and only one
electrician is available, adding more plumbers does not speed up the electrical work. The house
is finished only when all trades are complete; the slowest trade is the bottleneck.

:::{prf:remark} Per-step bounds from the blockage lemmas
:label: rem-per-step-bounds-from-blockage

{prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification` Part III is a **conditional** result: it reduces the
problem of blocking a composite algorithm to the problem of bounding the per-step capacity
$\delta_\lozenge(n)$ for each channel. The theorem itself does not establish these bounds; they
are **per-channel proof obligations** discharged by the blockage lemmas of Part VI.

Concretely, each blockage lemma must establish not merely that no pure $\lozenge$-witness
**solves the entire problem**, but the stronger quantitative statement that each transported
pure $\lozenge$-endomorphism has bounded per-step energy contribution:

| Channel | Source of per-step bound | Mechanism |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|
| $\sharp$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-metric-blockage` | Metric profile has bounded range $\Rightarrow$ $\lvert\Delta E_\sharp\rvert$ per step bounded by landscape geometry |
| $\int$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-causal-blockage` | Each causal step processes one poset level $\Rightarrow$ unit $E_\int$-progress per step |
| $\flat$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage` | Each algebraic step reduces one variable $\Rightarrow$ unit $E_\flat$-progress per step |
| $\ast$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-scaling-blockage` | Each recursive step processes one decomposition node $\Rightarrow$ bounded $E_\ast$-progress |
| $\partial$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage` | Each boundary step operates on the interface $\Rightarrow$ bounded $E_\partial$-progress |

The non-amplification theorem guarantees that **once these per-step bounds are established, no
inter-modal composition can circumvent them**. The five channels contribute independently, and
the weakest channel is the bottleneck.

**Critical dependency.** The theorem also rests on property 2 of
{prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition` (modal orthogonality), which states that transported
pure $\lozenge$-endomorphisms — including their encoding and reconstruction maps — preserve
non-$\lozenge$ energy components. This property is established for canonical 3-SAT in
{prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-modal-barrier-decomposition` (Step 2), where it follows from the
type-theoretic separation of modal workspaces
({prf:ref}`rem-modal-orthogonality-justification`): the reconstruction map $R^{\lozenge}$ writes
back only the $\lozenge$-component of the global state because the modal workspace
$\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$ is structurally disjoint from the non-$\lozenge$ components.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-$ from Modal Barrier Orthogonality
:label: thm-modal-barrier-obstruction-transfer

Let $\Pi$ be a problem family whose barrier datum $\mathfrak{B}$ admits a modal barrier decomposition ({prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition`). Suppose that for each $\lozenge \in \{\sharp, \int, \flat, \ast, \partial\}$:

1. The $\lozenge$-blockage holds: no pure $\lozenge$-witness at the problem types is correct for $\Pi$ ({prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-metric-blockage`–{prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage`).
2. The blockage is translator-stable ({prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`).

Then the semantic modal obstruction proposition $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi)$ holds for each $\lozenge$.

*Proof.*

Fix a modality $\lozenge$. Suppose toward contradiction that $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi)$ fails: there exists a correct solver $\mathcal{A} \in \mathsf{Sol}_{\mathrm{poly}}(\Pi)$ with a minimal-rank factorization tree $T$ containing an irreducible $\lozenge$-subtree $T_0$.

**Step 1. [Irreducible leaf structure]:**
By {prf:ref}`thm-irreducible-witness-classification`, $T_0$ has rank $(1,0)$: a single pure $\lozenge$-leaf $B: \mathfrak{U} \Rightarrow \mathfrak{V}$ with witness data $(E^\lozenge, F^\lozenge, R^\lozenge, \mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge)$, possibly wrapped by translator-conjugation nodes.

**Step 2. [Barrier decomposition on solver's state space]:**
Since $\mathcal{A}$ is a correct solver, its computation on the hard subfamily $\mathfrak{H}$ must cross the total barrier. By {prf:ref}`def-modal-barrier-decomposition` property 4 (independent sub-barrier crossing), the solver's path must cross each modal sub-barrier $E_\lozenge \geq b_\lozenge(n)$.

**Step 3. [Orthogonal energy accounting]:**
By property 2 (modal orthogonality), only $\lozenge$-computation can change $E_\lozenge$. The non-$\lozenge$ leaves in $T$ change only their respective energy components $E_{\lozenge'}$ for $\lozenge' \neq \lozenge$. Therefore the $\lozenge$-leaves in $T$ are solely responsible for crossing the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier.

**Step 4. [Transport to leaf's state space]:**
The irreducible leaf $B$ operates at types $(\mathfrak{U}, \mathfrak{V})$ via its modal endomorphism $F^\lozenge$ on $\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$. The barrier component $E_\lozenge$ is transported to $\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$ through the tree's connecting maps and $B$'s modal encoding $E^\lozenge$. By property 5 (translator stability of components) and {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`, the transported $\lozenge$-sub-barrier remains valid on $\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$ with $\Delta_\lozenge(n) = \Omega(n)$.

**Step 5. [Blockage contradicts crossing]:**
The $\lozenge$-blockage (hypothesis 1) says: no pure $\lozenge$-endomorphism with polynomial budget can cross the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier. Specifically, the modality-specific structural obstruction (glassy landscape for $\sharp$, causal depth for $\int$, etc.) prevents $F^\lozenge$ from navigating $E_\lozenge$ from below $b_\lozenge$ to below $a_\lozenge$ while passing through $E_\lozenge \geq b_\lozenge$. By translator stability, this holds regardless of the encoding into $\mathfrak{Z}^\lozenge$.

Therefore $B$ cannot cross the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier.

**Step 6. [All $\lozenge$-leaves blocked; contradiction]:**
The argument of Steps 4–5 applies to *every* pure $\lozenge$-leaf in $T$, not only $B$: each such leaf operates at intermediate types connected to the problem types by translator-conjugation nodes, so translator stability transfers the $\lozenge$-blockage to its state space. Therefore no $\lozenge$-leaf in $T$ can cross the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier. By Step 3, the $\lozenge$-sub-barrier cannot be crossed at all. But $\mathcal{A}$ is correct, so it must cross the total barrier on $\mathfrak{H}$, which requires crossing each sub-barrier (property 4). Contradiction.

Therefore no irreducible $\lozenge$-leaf exists in any solver's minimal-rank tree: $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi)$ holds. $\square$

Equivalently: if every irreducible modal route is blocked, then no polynomial-time correct solver exists for $\Pi$.

In particular, if $\Pi$ carries a full E13 obstruction package in the sense of

$$
\mathsf{Sol}_{\mathrm{poly}}(\Pi)=\varnothing.

By {prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`, $\mathcal A$ admits a finite modal factorization tree. Choose one of minimal

tree lies in one of the five pure modal subcategories

$$
\mathsf W_\sharp,\ \mathsf W_\int,\ \mathsf W_\flat,\ \mathsf W_\ast,\ \mathsf W_\partial.

Hence at least one admissible irreducible modal component exists for $\Pi$, belonging to one of those five classes.
This contradicts the conjunction of the five semantic obstruction propositions

$$
\mathbb K_\sharp^-(\Pi)\wedge \mathbb K_\int^-(\Pi)\wedge \mathbb K_\flat^-(\Pi)\wedge \mathbb K_\ast^-(\Pi)\wedge

If a problem family $\Pi$ is later shown to admit a polynomial-time correct solver despite all five semantic

Part V is **problem-agnostic**. It does not prove that any specific problem family satisfies the five semantic

hardness.

$\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}})$ directly.
:::

### VI. Canonical 3-SAT Instantiation and Separation

:::{prf:remark} Role of Part VI
:label: rem-role-of-part-vi

Parts I--V are framework-level. They define:
1. the internal/external machine bridge;
2. the normal-form theorem;
3. the universal properties of the five pure classes;
4. the witness decomposition and irreducible-classification theorems;
5. and the mixed-modal obstruction theorem.

Part VI is the first **problem-specific** instantiation of that machinery. Its task is to show that the canonical
internal $3$-SAT family:
1. is an admissible problem family;
2. lies in $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$ and is $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-complete;
3. carries the current tactic-level E13 obstruction package, or more strongly the reconstructed five-certificate
   semantic package of Part V;
4. and therefore lies outside $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$.

Once those steps are established, the separation chain is formal:

$$
\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}\notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}
\;\Longrightarrow\;
P_{\mathrm{FM}}\neq NP_{\mathrm{FM}}
\;\Longrightarrow\;
P_{\mathrm{DTM}}\neq NP_{\mathrm{DTM}}.
$$

The direct theorem route in this part is the current E13 antecedent package:

$$
K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E6}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E4}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E11}}^- \wedge
K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^{\mathrm{super}} \wedge K_{\mathrm{E8}}^-
\Rightarrow
K_{\mathrm{E13}}^+(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}})
\Rightarrow
\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}\notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}.
$$

The strengthened semantic obstruction framework of Part V (mixed-modal obstruction theorem) is a more demanding
formalization of that same exclusion route. It is a sufficient refinement of the current tactic-level theorem path,
not an additional logical prerequisite for invoking Definition {prf:ref}`def-e13` and Theorem
{prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness`. The audit-level implementation is developed in the companion document
*Algorithmic Extensions*.
:::

:::{prf:definition} E13: Algorithmic Completeness Lock
:label: def-e13

**Sieve Signature:**
- **Required Permits:** $\mathrm{Rep}_K$ (algorithm representation), $\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}$
- **Weakest Precondition:** $\{K_{\mathrm{Rep}_K}^+, K_{T_{\text{algorithmic}}}^+\}$ (algorithmic type with representation)
- **Produces:** a tactic-level frontend witness sufficient for the reconstructed E13 package
  {prf:ref}`def-e13-reconstructed`, hence for $K_{\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}}^{\mathrm{blk}}$
- **Blocks:** Polynomial-time bypass; validates universal scope certificates
- **Breached By:** Existence of a compatible modal profile in
  $\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle$

**Method:** Modal-profile obstruction analysis via pure witnesses and saturated closure

**Mechanism:** For problem $(\mathcal{X}, \Phi)$, check whether any internally polynomial-time solver can admit a modal
profile built from the five pure modalities with presentation translators as outer maps. If all pure leaves are
blocked and no closure route survives, the problem is hard inside $P_{\text{FM}}$. This six-term package is a
tactic-level frontend sufficient condition for the semantic obstruction established by the mixed-modal obstruction
theorem ({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`).

The five modal checks correspond to existing tactics and nodes:
- **$\sharp$ (Metric):** Uses Node 7 ($\mathrm{LS}_\sigma$) + Node 12 ($\mathrm{GC}_\nabla$)
- **$\int$ (Causal):** Uses **Tactic E6** (Causal/Well-Foundedness)
- **$\flat$ (Algebraic):** Uses **Tactic E4** (Integrality) + **Tactic E11** (Galois-Monodromy)
- **$\ast$ (Scaling):** Uses Node 4 ($\mathrm{SC}_\lambda$) for subcriticality
- **$\partial$ (Holographic):** Uses **Tactic E8** (DPI) + Node 6 ($\mathrm{Cap}_H$)

**Frontend Certificate Logic:**

$$K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E6}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E4}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E11}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^{\text{super}} \wedge K_{\mathrm{E8}}^- \Rightarrow K_{\mathrm{E13}}^+ \Rightarrow K_{\mathrm{Cat}_{\mathrm{Hom}}}^{\mathrm{blk}}$$

On the direct Part VI route, this implication is used exactly as written: once the six currently named frontend
obstruction certificates are established for the canonical problem object, the Algorithmic Completeness Lock yields
$K_{\mathrm{E13}}^+$. Part V (mixed-modal obstruction theorem) then provides the stronger semantic foundation for this exclusion route.

**Certificate Payload:** $(\text{modal\_status}[5], \text{leaf\_exclusions}[5], \text{profile\_exhaustion\_witness})$

**Automation:** Via composition of existing node/tactic evaluations; fully automatable for types with computable modality checks

:::{prf:proposition} Six Frontend Certificates Cover All Five Modal Channels

The six current frontend obstruction certificates of {prf:ref}`def-e13` establish the five semantic obstruction
propositions of {prf:ref}`def-semantic-modal-obstruction`:

| Frontend certificate | Modal channel | Blockage lemma establishing $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-$ |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| $K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^-$ | $\sharp$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-metric-blockage` |

| $K_{\mathrm{E8}}^-$ | $\partial$ | {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage` |

In particular, there are no additional direct-route witness channels beyond these five.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The five pure modal witness classes are exactly the irreducible generators of
$\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle$, by
{prf:ref}`thm-irreducible-witness-classification`. Each certificate in {prf:ref}`def-e13` targets one modal class.

For each modality $\lozenge$, the corresponding blockage lemma in Part VI establishes:
1. **Problem-level blockage:** No pure $\lozenge$-witness at the canonical 3-SAT types is correct.
2. **Translator stability:** Each blockage proof's Step 7 invokes
   {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`, ensuring blockage persists under admissible re-encodings.

By {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-modal-barrier-decomposition`, the canonical 3-SAT barrier datum
admits a modal barrier decomposition with independent sub-barriers of height $\Omega(n)$ for each modality.
By {prf:ref}`thm-modal-barrier-obstruction-transfer`, the problem-level blockage and translator
stability together yield the semantic obstruction proposition
$\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}})$ for each $\lozenge \in \{\sharp, \int, \flat, \ast, \partial\}$.

Since there are exactly five pure modal subcategories, there are no additional channels.

Equivalently:

$$
K_{\mathrm{E13}}^+(\Pi) \Rightarrow \Pi \notin P_{\text{FM}}.

**Counterexample form:** if the theorem were false, there would exist a problem family $\Pi$ with
$K_{\mathrm{E13}}^+(\Pi)$ and a uniform algorithm family $\mathcal{A} \in P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ solving $\Pi$ — i.e.,
a polynomial-time solver that is invisible to all five modal obstruction channels.

$$
\mathcal{A} \in P_{\mathrm{FM}}(\mathfrak{X}, \mathfrak{Y}; \sigma)
$$
solving $\Pi$.

**Step 1. [Semantic obstruction from frontend certificates]:**
The six frontend certificates comprising $K_{\mathrm{E13}}^+(\Pi)$ establish the five semantic obstruction
propositions $\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi)$ for each $\lozenge \in \{\sharp, \int, \flat, \ast, \partial\}$,
via {prf:ref}`prop-six-certificates-cover-five-channels`.

**Step 2. [Mixed-modal obstruction]:**
By {prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`, the conjunction of all five semantic obstructions implies
$\mathsf{Sol}_{\mathrm{poly}}(\Pi) = \varnothing$.

**Step 3. [Contradiction]:**
This contradicts the existence of $\mathcal{A}$. Therefore $\Pi \notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}$.

Within that route, overlap-gap or glassy-landscape arguments are only one possible backend for the $\sharp$-channel
certificate $K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^-$. They are not the unique gatekeeper for the full modal exhaustion argument, and

This is the unique satisfiability family used in the separation chain below.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Why the search formulation is essential
:label: rem-search-formulation-essential

**(a) Restriction monotonicity requires search.**
The hard subfamily $\mathfrak H$ ({prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`) consists exclusively of
**satisfiable** formulas. On this subfamily, the decision version of 3-SAT is trivially solvable by the
constant-$1$ function, which would make the restriction-monotonicity step
({prf:ref}`lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity`) vacuous: blockage on a trivially solvable subfamily
says nothing about the full problem. The search formulation avoids this collapse because producing a
satisfying assignment remains hard even when satisfiability is guaranteed.

**(b) Search hardness implies P $\neq$ NP for decision.**
Since search-SAT polynomial-time reduces to decision-SAT via self-reducibility (query the decision oracle
with successive variable fixings to extract an assignment bit-by-bit), proving that the search version
requires superpolynomial time implies that the decision version also requires superpolynomial time.
Formally, if decision-SAT were in $\mathsf{P}$, then the self-reduction would place search-SAT in
$\mathsf{FP}$, contradicting the search blockage.

**(c) Consistency with witness definitions and blockage proofs.**
All pure witness definitions and blockage proofs in Part VI use the search formulation: the "solved set"
$S_n$ is the set of satisfying assignments, and the "correctness condition" requires producing a
satisfying assignment (not merely a bit). The barrier datum
({prf:ref}`def-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum`) defines the solved region as $S_n = \{x \in \{0,1\}^n :
x \text{ satisfies all clauses of } F\}$, and the reconstruction map $r_n$ extracts a satisfying
assignment from a solved state.

2. the verifier relation $\mathsf{Ver}^{3\text{-SAT}}_n(F,a)$ is decidable uniformly in time polynomial in $n$;

The assignment-or-rejection output family $\mathfrak A$ is admissible: each level
$\{0,1\}^{\le n} \cup \{\bot\}$ is a finite set with canonical bitstring encoding (assignments padded to
length $n$, $\bot$ encoded as a reserved codeword), polynomial-time validity testing, and injective
encoding. The witness family

For the verifier, given a formula $F\in F_n$ and an assignment $a\in W_n$, one evaluates each clause by reading at most
three literals and checking whether at least one is satisfied by $a$. Since the number of clauses and variables encoded
in $F$ is $O(n)$, the total runtime is polynomial in $n$.

The search-specification relation is therefore well-defined, and all admissibility conditions hold.

:::{prf:definition} Current Frontend E13 Package for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: def-current-frontend-e13-package-3sat

We say that the canonical satisfiability family $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$ carries the **current tactic-level E13 frontend
package** if the six currently named frontend obstruction certificates all hold on that family:

$$
K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E6}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E4}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E11}}^- \wedge
K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^{\mathrm{super}} \wedge K_{\mathrm{E8}}^-.
$$

This is exactly the antecedent package displayed in Definition {prf:ref}`def-e13`, now specialized to the canonical
internal $3$-SAT problem object.

:::{prf:lemma} Restriction Monotonicity for the Current Frontend Obstruction Templates
:label: lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity

Let

$$
\Pi'=(\mathfrak X',\mathfrak Y,\mathsf{Spec}')
$$
be obtained from a problem family

$$
\Pi=(\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y,\mathsf{Spec})
$$
by restricting the admissible input family to an admissibly presented subfamily

$$
X_n'\subseteq X_n
\qquad (n\in\mathbb N),
$$
and restricting the specification relation accordingly.

Then any current frontend witness template or tactic-level certificate for one of the five modal channels

$$
\sharp,\ \int,\ \flat,\ \ast,\ \partial
$$
restricts from $\Pi$ to $\Pi'$. Equivalently: if a current frontend obstruction certificate blocks one of those
channels on $\Pi'$, then the same channel is blocked on $\Pi$.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
We verify for each of the five witness classes that a witness on the full family $\Pi$ restricts to a witness on the
subfamily $\Pi'$, and contrapositively that an obstruction on $\Pi'$ implies an obstruction on $\Pi$.

**$\sharp$-channel.** A pure $\sharp$-witness on $\Pi$ provides a ranking function $V_n^\sharp$, a local update
$F_n^\sharp$, and a solved set $S_n^\sharp$ satisfying strict progress and correctness for all $x \in X_n$.
Restricting to $X_n' \subseteq X_n$ preserves all three properties (the quantifier narrows). Hence any $\sharp$-witness
on $\Pi$ restricts to a valid $\sharp$-witness on $\Pi'$.

**$\int$-channel.** A pure $\int$-witness on $\Pi$ provides a poset $(P_n, \prec_n)$, local updates, and a linear
extension satisfying correctness for all $x \in X_n$. Restricting to $X_n'$ preserves the poset structure and the
correctness condition.

**$\flat$-channel.** A pure $\flat$-witness on $\Pi$ provides algebraic structures $A_n^\flat, B_n^\flat$ and a sketch
$s_n \to e_n \to d_n$ with correctness for all $x \in X_n$. The sketch operates uniformly; restricting the input
family preserves structure cardinalities, elimination maps, and correctness.

**$\ast$-channel.** A pure $\ast$-witness on $\Pi$ provides a splitting map, merge map, and recursion-tree structure
with correctness for all $x \in X_n$. Restricting to $X_n'$ preserves the recursion-tree structure, the size decrease
property, and correctness.

**$\partial$-channel.** A pure $\partial$-witness on $\Pi$ provides interface objects $B_n^\partial$ and contraction
maps with correctness for all $x \in X_n$. Restricting preserves interface size bounds and correctness.

In each case, the crucial observation is: a pure $\lozenge$-witness is defined by a universally quantified correctness
condition over the input family. Restricting the input family to a subfamily only narrows the universal quantifier.
Contrapositively, if no valid $\lozenge$-witness exists on $\Pi'$ (i.e., the $\lozenge$-channel is obstructed on the
subfamily), then no valid $\lozenge$-witness exists on $\Pi$ either.

### VI.C.1. Hard Subfamily and Canonical Barrier Datum

:::{prf:definition} Hard Subfamily for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: def-hard-subfamily-3sat

The **hard subfamily** of canonical 3-SAT is the restricted problem family

$$
\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}^{\mathrm{hard}}
=
(\mathfrak{H}, \mathfrak{A}, \mathsf{Spec}^{3\text{-SAT}}|_{\mathfrak{H}})
$$

where $\mathfrak{H} = (\mathfrak{H}_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\mathfrak{H}_n$ consists of all **satisfiable**
3-CNF formulas on $n$ variables at clause-to-variable ratio

$$
\alpha = 4.2
$$

(slightly below the random 3-SAT satisfiability threshold $\alpha^* \approx 4.267$, so that a
uniformly random 3-CNF formula at ratio $\alpha$ is satisfiable with probability $1 - o(1)$).
More precisely, $\mathfrak{H}_n$ consists of formulas with $m = \lfloor \alpha n \rfloor$ clauses,
each clause a disjunction of 3 literals over $n$ variables, such that the formula is satisfiable.

$\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}^{\mathrm{hard}}$ is an admissibly presented subfamily of $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$: the restriction
$\mathfrak{H}_n \subseteq F_{3\text{-CNF},n}$ is admissible because membership in $\mathfrak{H}_n$ is decidable
(satisfiability is decidable, clause-to-variable ratio is computable, and each structural property below is
decidable given the formula).

We define $\mathfrak{H}_n$ to consist of those formulas in $F_{3\text{-CNF},n}$ at ratio $\alpha$ that
**deterministically satisfy** all six structural properties below. By known probabilistic results, a
$(1 - o(1))$-fraction of satisfiable formulas at ratio $\alpha$ satisfy all six properties simultaneously as
$n \to \infty$, so $\mathfrak{H}_n$ is non-empty for all sufficiently large $n$.

The six definitional requirements for $F \in \mathfrak{H}_n$ are:

1. **Solution-space shattering:** The satisfying assignments partition into $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters at pairwise
   Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$ (Achlioptas-Ricci-Tersenghi 2006, Mézard-Montanari 2009).
2. **Glassy landscape:** The energy function $E_n(x) =$ unsatisfied clauses has exponentially many local minima,
   vanishing spectral gap, and Łojasiewicz failure near frozen variables (Mézard-Parisi-Zecchina 2002,
   Montanari-Semerjian 2006).
3. **Frustrated cycles:** The clause-variable dependency graph contains strongly connected frustration cores of size
   $\Theta(n)$ (Achlioptas-Beame-Molloy 2001).
4. **Linear expansion:** The clause-variable incidence graph is an expander with linear separator cost and linear
   treewidth.
5. **Automorphism triviality:** $\operatorname{Aut}(F) = \{\mathrm{id}\}$.
6. **Boolean fiber rigidity:** The algebraic variety $V(F)$ defined by the clause polynomials
   $\bar{l}_{1i}\bar{l}_{2i}\bar{l}_{3i} = 0$ together with the Boolean constraints $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ coincides
   with the Boolean solution set $\mathrm{Sol}(F) \subset \{0,1\}^n$ (no additional complex solutions). The
   monodromy of the resulting discrete covering over the clause-weight parameter space is trivial.

   *Justification.* Over $\mathbb{F}_2$, the constraints $z_j^2 = z_j$ are automatically satisfied
   (every element of $\mathbb{F}_2$ is idempotent), and each clause polynomial
   $\bar{l}_{1i}\bar{l}_{2i}\bar{l}_{3i}$ is a product of linear forms over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
   The ideal generated by all clause polynomials together with $\{z_j^2 - z_j\}_{j=1}^n$ is
   radical over $\mathbb{F}_2$ (since $\mathbb{F}_2[z_1,\ldots,z_n]/(z_j^2 - z_j)$ is a reduced
   ring), so $V(F) = \mathrm{Sol}(F)$ by the Nullstellensatz over finite fields
   (see, e.g., Cox-Little-O'Shea, *Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms*, Ch. 8, or
   Jukna, *Boolean Function Complexity*, Ch. 6 for the Boolean-algebraic perspective).
   The monodromy triviality then follows: since the fiber over each parameter value is a
   discrete finite set of Boolean points with no algebraic monodromy paths connecting them,
   the monodromy group is $\{\mathrm{id}\}$.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Well-definedness and non-circularity of the hard subfamily
:label: rem-hard-subfamily-well-definedness

**Non-emptiness.** Each of the six structural properties is satisfied with probability $1 - o(1)$
by uniformly random satisfiable 3-CNF formulas at ratio $\alpha < \alpha^*$. Properties 1–6
are standard results in the statistical physics and combinatorics literature cited above. By a
union bound over all six properties, they hold simultaneously with probability $1 - o(1)$, so
$H_n \neq \emptyset$ for all sufficiently large $n$.

*Note on solution density.* The density bound $|\{y \in \mathrm{Sol}(F) : |y|=w\}| \leq
(7/8)^{\alpha n/2}\binom{n}{w}$ is *not* a definitional property of $H_n$, but is derived
inline in the proof of {prf:ref}`lem-sharp-obstruction`. It defines the auxiliary sub-family
$H_n^+ \subseteq H_n$, and the key point is that $|H_n^+| \geq (1-o(1))|H_n|$ because the
Markov bound applies to the unconditional distribution at ratio $\alpha < \alpha^*$, where
$\Pr[F \text{ satisfiable}] = 1-o(1)$ ensures the conditioning on satisfiability does not
inflate the failure probability beyond $o(1)$. At $\alpha \geq \alpha^*$, this conditioning
argument would fail (satisfiability probability drops to $\exp(-\Omega(n))$), which is why
$\alpha$ is chosen strictly below $\alpha^*$.

**Decidability note.** Membership in $H_n$ requires checking satisfiability, which is NP-complete.
However, decidability of $H_n$ is NOT required by the proof. The proof uses $H_n$ only through
{prf:ref}`lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity`: if no pure $\lozenge$-witness is valid on $H_n$,
then no pure $\lozenge$-witness is valid on the full family $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$. This transfer
requires only $H_n \subseteq \Pi_{3\text{-SAT},n}$ and $H_n \neq \emptyset$.

**No circularity.** The hard subfamily is a combinatorially defined set whose non-emptiness is
proved by probabilistic counting, not by appeal to computational complexity assumptions. The
blockage lemmas prove that certain witness structures cannot solve instances in $H_n$; they do
not need to construct elements of $H_n$ algorithmically.

:::{prf:definition} Canonical 3-SAT Barrier Datum
:label: def-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum

The **canonical 3-SAT barrier datum** is the tuple

$$
\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}
=
\bigl(
\mathfrak Z,\ i,\ \mathfrak H,\ S,\ r,\ E,\ a,\ b
\bigr)
$$
in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-barrier-datum`, with the following instantiations.

1. **State family.**
   $Z_n = \{0,1\}^n$ is the assignment space for formulas on $n$ Boolean variables, with Hamming encoding.

2. **Input embedding.**
   $i_n$ maps a formula $F$ on $n$ variables to a canonical initial assignment $x_0(F) \in \{0,1\}^n$, computed in
   polynomial time from $F$ (e.g., by a fixed polynomial-time heuristic such as unit propagation followed by greedy
   clause satisfaction). The embedding is a presentation translator.

3. **Hard subfamily.**
   $\mathfrak H_n$ consists of satisfiable formulas at clause-to-variable ratio

   $$
   \alpha = 4.2
   $$
   (slightly below the random 3-SAT satisfiability threshold $\alpha^* \approx 4.267$).

4. **Solved region.**
   $S_n = \{x \in \{0,1\}^n : x \text{ satisfies all clauses of } F\}$
   is the set of satisfying assignments.

5. **Reconstruction.**
   $r_n$ extracts the satisfying assignment from a solved state by reading the assignment bits.

6. **Energy functional.**

   $$
   E_n(x) = \text{number of clauses of } F \text{ unsatisfied by assignment } x.
   $$

7. **Thresholds.**

   $$
   a(n) = \lceil \alpha n / 8 \rceil + 1,
   \qquad
   b(n) = c_{\mathrm{shatter}} \cdot n,
   $$
   where $c_{\mathrm{shatter}} > 0$ is the shattering barrier constant (see
   {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum-valid`). The requirement $a(n) < b(n)$ holds for sufficiently large
   $n$ since $c_{\mathrm{shatter}} > \alpha / 8$ (established by the cluster separation property).
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Validity of the Canonical 3-SAT Barrier Datum
:label: thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum-valid

The barrier datum $\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}$ of {prf:ref}`def-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum` satisfies the three axioms
of {prf:ref}`def-barrier-datum`:

1. **(B1)** Source states satisfy $E_n(i_n(F)) \leq a(n)$ for all $F \in H_n$.

2. **(B2)** Solved states satisfy $E_n(z) = 0 \leq a(n)$ for all $z \in S_n$.

3. **(B3)** Every admissible solver trace from $i_n(F)$ to $S_n$ must pass through a state with
   $E_n \geq b(n) = c_{\mathrm{shatter}} \cdot n$.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [B1 — low-energy source condition]:**
For every $F \in H_n$, by Property 4 (linear expansion) of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`,
$F$ has well-defined clause structure with $m = \lfloor \alpha n \rfloor$ clauses. The canonical
initial assignment $x_0(F)$ produced by the polynomial-time greedy heuristic satisfies at least a
$(7/8)$-fraction of the $m$ clauses (since each 3-clause is satisfied by $7$ of $8$ truth assignments
to its $3$ variables). Therefore:

$$
E_n(x_0(F)) \leq \lceil \alpha n / 8 \rceil + 1 = a(n).
$$

**Step 2. [B2 — low-energy solved condition]:**
By definition, $x \in S_n$ satisfies all clauses, so $E_n(x) = 0 \leq a(n)$.

**Step 3. [B3 — barrier separation]:**
For random 3-SAT at the satisfiability threshold $\alpha \approx 4.267$, the solution space undergoes
**shattering** into exponentially many well-separated clusters (Achlioptas-Ricci-Tersenghi 2006,
Mézard-Montanari 2009). For every $F \in H_n$ (which satisfies all six structural properties by definition):

- The satisfying assignments partition into clusters $C_1, \dots, C_k$ with $k = \exp(\Theta(n))$.
- Any two assignments in distinct clusters have Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$.
- Any path in assignment space connecting two assignments in distinct clusters must pass through assignments
  violating at least $c_{\mathrm{shatter}} \cdot n$ clauses.

The last property follows from the expansion of the random 3-SAT clause-variable hypergraph: each variable appears in
$\Theta(\alpha) = \Theta(1)$ clauses, and any contiguous set of $\Omega(n)$ variable flips from a satisfying
assignment unsatisfies at least $c_{\mathrm{shatter}} \cdot n$ clauses for an explicit constant
$c_{\mathrm{shatter}} > \alpha / 8 > 0$ depending on $\alpha$ and the expansion constant.

The initial assignment $x_0(F)$ lies outside all solution clusters (its Hamming distance to every satisfying
assignment is $\Omega(n)$, since the heuristic satisfies only $7/8$ of clauses while a satisfying assignment
satisfies all, and by Property 1 (shattering) the clusters are well-separated). By the expansion of the clause-variable hypergraph, any path from $x_0(F)$ to a satisfying assignment
must traverse $\Omega(n)$ variable flips. At the point where approximately half the required flips have been made,
the assignment simultaneously fails to satisfy the clauses that the initial heuristic satisfied AND fails to satisfy
the clauses of the target cluster, yielding energy $\geq c_{\mathrm{shatter}} \cdot n$.

This establishes B3 with barrier height
$\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n) = b(n) - a(n) = (c_{\mathrm{shatter}} - \alpha/8) \cdot n - O(1) = \Theta(n)$.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Barrier datum scope and the Overlap Gap Property
:label: rem-ogp-exponential-barrier

The clause-count barrier datum $\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}$ gives a barrier height $\Delta = \Theta(n)$. Combined with
the local drift bound $d_\lozenge(n) = O(1)$, the Part IX barrier metatheorems yield

$$
\beta_\lozenge^{\mathfrak B}(n) \geq \Omega(n),
$$
a linear lower bound on the minimum number of steps, cardinality ($\flat$-channel), or interface size ($\partial$-channel).

This linear lower bound provides useful structural information (e.g., ruling out $o(n)$-step witnesses) but does not by
itself rule out polynomial-time witnesses with ranking bound $q(n) = n^k$ for large $k$.

The full blockage of each channel at the **superpolynomial** level requires channel-specific structural arguments
beyond the simple energy-barrier model, deployed below via the frontend obstruction lemmas. Those arguments exploit
properties such as:
- **Glassy landscape + ♯-purity** (sharp): cluster shattering with frozen-variable core ($\int$-type)
  renders metric-descent ($\sharp$-modal) computation cluster-blind (Mézard-Parisi-Zecchina 2002,
  Achlioptas-Coja-Oghlan 2008);
- **Frustrated cycles** (causal): strongly connected frustration cores preventing DAG-like elimination
  (Achlioptas-Beame-Molloy 2001);
- **Supercritical expansion** (scaling): linear boundary size preventing subcritical recursion;
- **Unbounded treewidth** (boundary): linear treewidth preventing polynomial-size interface compression.

A stronger barrier datum using the **Overlap Gap Property** (OGP) (Gamarnik-Sudan 2017) could in principle provide
superpolynomial lower bounds through the Part IX metatheorems, but this requires a different state family and energy
functional (based on overlap structure rather than clause count). Such a construction is deferred to the optional
backend dossier route (see companion document *Algorithmic Extensions*); it is not needed for the direct Part VI
route, which uses the frontend obstruction lemmas.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Two-level architecture of the blockage proofs
:label: rem-two-level-blockage-architecture

The five blockage lemmas ({prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-metric-blockage` through {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage`)
each employ a **two-level exclusion architecture**. It is important to understand the distinct roles of
these two levels and their logical independence.

**Level 1 — Barrier framework (supporting role).**
Each blockage proof contains a "Step 5: Supporting barrier bound" that invokes the Part IX barrier
metatheorems via the barrier datum $\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}$. This yields a lower bound
$\beta_\lozenge^{\mathfrak B}(n) \geq \Omega(n)$ on the channel-specific resource parameter. The role of
this bound is to provide a **quantitative floor**: it rules out all witnesses whose resource parameter is
sublinear, i.e., $o(n)$-step or $o(n)$-size witnesses. This is useful structural information but, as
noted in {prf:ref}`rem-ogp-exponential-barrier`, it does not by itself exclude polynomial-time witnesses
with ranking bound $q(n) = n^k$ for arbitrarily large $k$.

**Level 2 — Frontend structural obstruction (main exclusion).**
The actual exclusion of *all* polynomial-time witnesses — including those with $q(n) = n^k$ for any
fixed $k$ — is accomplished by the channel-specific structural arguments in Steps 2–4 of each blockage
proof. These arguments identify obstructions that are **independent of the degree of the polynomial
ranking bound**:

- **Sharp channel ($\sharp$):** The $\sharp$-purity constraint restricts $F_n^\sharp$ to
  metric-descent computation — $F$ can access metric/potential information (rank, energy,
  distances) but not constraint-graph structure ($\int$-type) or algebraic identities ($\flat$-type).
  On the shattered landscape with $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters, the vanishing spectral gap renders
  metric information cluster-uninformative, and cluster identity is determined by the frozen-variable
  core (an $\int$-type object invisible to the $\sharp$ modality). No $\sharp$-modal $F$ can
  navigate to the correct cluster, regardless of the degree of $q_\sharp(n)$.

- **Causal channel ($\int$):** Frustrated cycles in the clause-variable hypergraph are a structural
  obstruction to DAG-like elimination orderings. Their presence is independent of the poset size
  $q_\int(n)$.

- **Algebraic channel ($\flat$):** Boolean fiber rigidity trivializes the monodromy of the solution variety,
  making the solvable-monodromy sketch vacuous. This is a structural obstruction independent of the cardinality bound $q_\flat(n)$.

- **Scaling channel ($\ast$):** Coupling through $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints prevents polynomial
  total recursion-tree size. The supercritical expansion holds regardless of the degree of $q_\ast(n)$.

- **Boundary channel ($\partial$):** Linear treewidth $\operatorname{tw}(G_n) = \Theta(n)$ of the
  constraint hypergraph forces exponential contraction time $2^{\Omega(n)}$, because the contraction
  must process $2^{\Omega(\operatorname{tw})}$ feasible separator configurations. This
  exponential-time obstruction holds regardless of the degree of $q_\partial(n)$.

**Logical independence.**
Level 2 does *not* depend on Level 1. The frontend structural obstructions are self-contained arguments
that would remain valid even if the barrier metatheorems of Part IX were removed entirely. The barrier
framework provides supplementary quantitative information (the $\Omega(n)$ floor) and connects the
blockage lemmas to the broader energy-landscape theory, but it is not a logical prerequisite for the
polynomial-time exclusion established by the frontend obstruction arguments.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Translator Stability of the Canonical 3-SAT Barrier Datum
:label: thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable

The barrier datum $\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}$ is translator-stable in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-translator-stable-barrier`:

1. Presentation translators applied to $\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}$ produce polynomial-size outputs.
2. Energy distortion under translation is bounded by a polynomial factor: for any presentation translator $T$,

   $$
   E_n^T(T(x)) \leq p(E_n(x))
   $$
   for some polynomial $p$ depending only on the translator.
3. Barrier separation ratio is preserved:

   $$
   \frac{\Delta_{T\mathfrak B}(n)}{\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)} \geq \frac{1}{p(n)}
   $$
   for a polynomial $p$, so the $\Theta(n)$ barrier height remains $\Theta(n)$ after translation.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Polynomial output size]:**
By definition of presentation translator, any such translator $T$ produces
outputs of size at most $p_T(n)$ for a polynomial $p_T$.

**Step 2. [Energy distortion bound]:**
The energy functional $E_n(x)$ counts unsatisfied clauses. Under a presentation translator $T$ that re-encodes the
formula and assignment, the re-encoded formula has at most $p_T(m)$ clauses where $m$ is the original clause count.
Each re-encoded clause depends on at most $p_T(1)$ re-encoded variables. Therefore the number of unsatisfied
re-encoded clauses is at most a polynomial multiple of the original count.

**Step 3. [Barrier ratio preservation]:**
The barrier height $\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n) = b(n) - a(n) = \Theta(n)$. After translation,
$\Delta_{T\mathfrak B}(n) \geq \Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n) / p(n)$ by the energy distortion bound. Since
$\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n) = \Theta(n)$ and $p(n)$ is polynomial, $\Delta_{T\mathfrak B}(n) = \Omega(n / p(n))$, which
remains $\Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ with appropriate choice of $p$.
:::

### VI.C.2. The Five Blockage Theorems

Each of the following lemmas proves blockage for one modal channel by assuming an arbitrary pure witness of the
corresponding type on $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$ and deriving a contradiction. In each case, the proof first establishes
the structural obstruction on the hard subfamily $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}^{\mathrm{hard}}$
({prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`), then lifts via {prf:ref}`lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity`.

:::{prf:remark} Scope of the direct-route blockage proofs
:label: rem-scope-direct-route-blockage

**What the direct route proves.** Each blockage lemma below establishes the semantic obstruction proposition
$\mathbb{K}_\lozenge^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}})$ for its modal channel by two complementary arguments:

1. **Frontend structural blockage.** All pure $\lozenge$-witnesses are blocked for
   $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}^{\mathrm{hard}}$ via the corresponding frontend obstruction lemma. (For the $\sharp$-channel,
   the obstruction uses $\sharp$-purity to show that metric-descent computation is cluster-blind on the shattered
   landscape. For the other channels, the obstruction blocks the named class template and, by the structure of the
   pure witness definitions, extends to all pure witnesses of that modality.)

2. **Barrier-derived quantitative bound.** The barrier datum $\mathfrak{B}_{3\text{-SAT}}$ gives a linear lower
   bound $\beta_\lozenge \geq \Omega(n)$ via the Part IX metatheorems, ruling out all pure $\lozenge$-witnesses with
   sublinear ranking bound or resource parameter.

Together, these establish the semantic obstruction propositions required by the mixed-modal obstruction theorem
({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`).
:::

:::{prf:remark} The saturated closure argument
:label: rem-saturated-closure-argument

The mixed-modal obstruction theorem ({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`) handles the saturated closure
argument directly: if all five semantic obstruction propositions hold, then no element of
$\mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp, \int, \flat, \ast, \partial \rangle$ solves $\Pi$, because every factorization tree
has leaves in the five pure modal subcategories, and each is blocked.

The proof is by contradiction: any solver in $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ decomposes ({prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`)
into pure modal leaves ({prf:ref}`thm-irreducible-witness-classification`), but each leaf type is excluded by the
corresponding semantic obstruction.
:::

:::{prf:lemma} Metric Blockage for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: lem-random-3sat-metric-blockage

For every pure $\sharp$-witness $(V_n^\sharp, F_n^\sharp, S_n^\sharp, q_\sharp)$ in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous` on $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$, the correctness condition fails. Equivalently,
the metric obstruction certificate $K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^-$ holds.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed witness class]:**
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`: a pure $\sharp$-witness consists of a ranking function
$V_n^\sharp: Z_n^\sharp \to \mathbb N$ bounded by polynomial $q_\sharp(n)$, a $\sharp$-modal update $F_n^\sharp$,
a solved set $S_n^\sharp$, strict progress ($V_n$ decreases by at least 1 per non-solved step), and the correctness
identity. The exclusion target is all such witnesses — not only the Class I climber template of
{prf:ref}`def-class-i-climbers`, but every pure $\sharp$-witness regardless of the choice of $V$, $F$, or encoding.

**Step 2. [Glassy landscape of random 3-SAT]:**
For random 3-SAT at the satisfiability threshold $\alpha \approx 4.267$, the landscape
$\Phi(x) = E_n(x) = $ number of unsatisfied clauses exhibits all three glassy signatures required by
{prf:ref}`lem-sharp-obstruction`:

- **Cluster shattering with frozen core:** The solution space shatters into $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters at pairwise
  Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$ (Achlioptas-Ricci-Tersenghi 2006). Within each cluster, a $\Theta(n)$-fraction of
  variables are frozen to specific values by the implication structure of the constraint graph
  (Achlioptas-Coja-Oghlan 2008). Different clusters have different frozen cores.
- **Vanishing spectral gap:** The Glauber dynamics transition matrix on the hard subfamily has spectral gap
  $\lambda_{\min} \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, yielding mixing time $\exp(\Omega(n))$ (Montanari-Semerjian 2006).
  Metric-local information carries negligible cluster-identity signal.
- **Łojasiewicz failure:** The inequality $\|\nabla\Phi(x)\| \geq c|\Phi(x)-\Phi^*|^{1-\theta}$ fails for any
  fixed $\theta > 0$: near frozen-variable configurations, the gradient vanishes while the energy gap to the
  nearest solution remains $\Theta(n)$. Gradient-based descent is cluster-uninformative.

**Step 3. [Frontend obstruction application]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-sharp-obstruction`: the $\sharp$-purity constraint restricts $F_n^\sharp$ to metric-descent
computation, and the glassy landscape ensures that metric-descent computation cannot navigate to the correct
solution cluster (cluster identity is determined by the frozen-variable core, an $\int$-type object invisible to
the $\sharp$ modality). Therefore no pure $\sharp$-witness exists on the hard subfamily $\mathfrak H$.

**Step 4. [Restriction monotonicity]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity`: the blockage lifts from the hard subfamily to the full canonical
family $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$. Thus no pure $\sharp$-witness exists on $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$.

**Step 5. [Supporting barrier bound]:**
The barrier datum $\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}$ of {prf:ref}`def-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum` provides a supporting
quantitative lower bound. Each $\sharp$-update changes $E_n$ by at most
$d_\sharp(n) \leq 3 \cdot \lceil\alpha\rceil = O(1)$ (a sharp local drift bound in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-sharp-local-energy-drift-bound`). By {prf:ref}`thm-sharp-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`:
$\beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B}(n) \geq \Omega(n)$, ruling out any witness with sublinear ranking bound.

**Step 6. [Certificate extraction]:**
The metric obstruction certificate is

$$
K_{\mathrm{LS}_\sigma}^-.
$$

**Step 7. [Translator stability]:**
By {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`, the clause-count barrier datum is translator-stable, so
the linear lower bound is preserved under admissible re-encodings.

**Step 8. [Failure localization]:**
If the theorem were false, a pure $\sharp$-witness with polynomial ranking bound would exist for
$\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$. By $\sharp$-purity, $F$ would be limited to metric-descent operations. But the shattered
landscape (exponentially many clusters with frozen cores, vanishing spectral gap, Łojasiewicz failure) ensures that
metric-descent operations cannot identify or navigate to the correct solution cluster — the cluster-identity
information is encoded in the constraint-graph topology ($\int$-type), not in metric quantities ($\sharp$-type).
The failure point is the modal mismatch: the computational task requires $\int$-type information that the
$\sharp$-modality cannot access.

:::{prf:lemma} Causal Blockage for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: lem-random-3sat-causal-blockage

For every pure $\int$-witness $(P_n, \prec_n, U_{n,i}, \sigma_n, q_\int)$ in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous` on $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$, the correctness condition fails. Equivalently,
the causal obstruction certificate $K_{\mathrm{E6}}^-$ holds.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed witness class]:**
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`: a pure $\int$-witness consists of a finite poset $(P_n, \prec_n)$ with
$|P_n| \leq q_\int(n)$, local updates $U_{n,i}$ depending only on predecessors $j \prec_n i$, a linear extension
$\sigma_n$, and the correctness identity. The exclusion target is all such witnesses.

**Step 2. [Frustrated cycles in random 3-SAT]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-shape-obstruction`, the causal/propagation witness language is blocked when the dependency structure
contains **frustrated loops**. For random 3-SAT at threshold $\alpha \approx 4.267$:

- The clause-variable dependency graph contains **strongly connected frustration cores**: cycles of clauses
  $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_\ell$ where satisfying $c_j$ forces a literal value that conflicts with $c_{j+1}$
  (Achlioptas-Beame-Molloy 2001).
- These frustration cores have $\pi_1(\int\mathcal X) \neq 0$: the fundamental group of the shape is non-trivial.
  Constraint propagation around any such cycle produces contradictions.
- W.h.p. the hard subfamily contains frustration cores of size $\Theta(n)$, involving a constant fraction of all
  variables.

**Step 3. [Elimination order obstruction]:**
Any pure $\int$-witness imposes a DAG-compatible elimination order on the variables. But a frustration core of size
$\Theta(n)$ is a **strongly connected** subgraph of the dependency graph: for any two variables $v_i, v_j$ in the
core, there exist directed paths $v_i \to \cdots \to v_j$ and $v_j \to \cdots \to v_i$. Therefore no elimination
order (linear extension of any compatible poset) can process the core without encountering a cycle, requiring the
elimination to "resolve" a circular dependency — which a pure $\int$-witness cannot do by definition (each local
update depends only on predecessors).

**Step 4. [Frontend obstruction application]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-shape-obstruction`: the frustrated-loop structure blocks the standard propagation/elimination witness
language of {prf:ref}`def-class-ii-propagators` on the hard subfamily.

**Step 5. [Restriction monotonicity]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity`: the blockage lifts from the hard subfamily to the full canonical
family $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$.

**Step 6. [Supporting barrier bound]:**
The barrier datum $\mathfrak B_{3\text{-SAT}}$ provides a supporting linear lower bound. Each local elimination update
changes $E_n$ by at most $d_\int(n) \leq 3 \cdot \lceil\alpha\rceil = O(1)$ (an $\int$ local drift bound in the
sense of {prf:ref}`def-int-local-energy-drift-bound`). By {prf:ref}`thm-int-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`:
$\beta_\int^{\mathfrak B}(n) \geq \Omega(n)$, ruling out sublinear elimination schedules.

**Step 7. [Certificate extraction]:**
The causal obstruction certificate is

$$
K_{\mathrm{E6}}^-.
$$

**Step 8. [Translator stability + Failure localization]:**
Translator stability is inherited from {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`. The failure point is
the frustrated-cycle structure: if random 3-SAT at threshold had acyclic constraint propagation (like Horn-SAT, where
the implication graph is a DAG), the $\int$-route would not be blocked.

:::{prf:lemma} Causal blockage transfers to arbitrary posets
:label: lem-causal-arbitrary-poset-transfer

Let $(P_n, \prec_n)$ be any well-founded poset with $|P_n| \leq q(n)$ for a polynomial $q$, and let
$(U_{n,i})_{i \in P_n}$ be local updates depending only on predecessors, with reconstruction map
$R_n^{\int}$ computable in polynomial time. Then no pure $\int$-witness with poset $(P_n, \prec_n)$
correctly solves the hard subfamily $\mathfrak{H}$ of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Fix an arbitrary linear extension $\sigma_n$ of $(P_n, \prec_n)$ and consider the state
$\mathrm{state}_k$ after the first $k$ updates in this linear extension have been applied.

**Step 1. [Determined variable set.]**
Define the *determined variable set* at step $k$:

$$
V_k := \bigl\{j \in [n] : \text{the } j\text{th coordinate of } R_n^{\int}(\mathrm{state}_k)
\text{ is fixed regardless of how the remaining } |P_n| - k \text{ updates proceed}\bigr\}.
$$
That is, variable $j$ is determined at step $k$ if every completion of the remaining updates (consistent
with the poset and the input) yields the same value for the $j$th output coordinate.

**Step 2. [Boundary conditions.]**
$V_0 = \varnothing$: before any updates, the state is the initial encoding of the input, and no output
coordinate is fixed. Formally: by property 1 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`
(**solution-space shattering**), every formula $F \in \mathfrak{H}_n$ has $\exp(\Theta(n))$
satisfying assignments partitioned into clusters at pairwise Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$
({cite}`AchlioptasRicciTersenghi06`; {cite}`MezardMontanari09`; rigorously established in ZFC by
{cite}`DingSlySun21`). In particular, for any variable $j \in [n]$, there exist satisfying
assignments $x, x' \in \mathrm{Sol}(F)$ with $x_j \neq x'_j$ (since clusters exist on both sides
of every variable's hyperplane, by the $\Omega(n)$ pairwise Hamming distance lower bound). The encoding $E_n^{\int}(F)$ contains the formula but not a pre-chosen satisfying
assignment — the initial state $\mathrm{state}_0$ encodes $F$ and no update has yet been applied.
Since the proof proceeds by contradiction (we assume the $\int$-witness is correct), every valid
completion of the remaining $|P_n|$ updates from $\mathrm{state}_0$ (in any poset-consistent
ordering) produces a satisfying assignment. Because $F$ has satisfying assignments with $x_j = 0$
and with $x_j' = 1$, different poset-consistent completions are free to land on assignments with
different $j$-values — no specific $j$-value is pre-committed in $\mathrm{state}_0$ alone.
Hence $j \notin V_0$. Since $j$ was arbitrary, $V_0 = \varnothing$.

$V_{|P_n|} = [n]$: by the correctness condition of the $\int$-witness, after all updates the
reconstruction map must produce a valid satisfying assignment, so every coordinate is determined.

:::{prf:remark} Import of classical ZFC cluster theorem into the framework
:label: rem-causal-blockage-classical-import

The solution-space shattering used in Step 2 is a theorem of classical combinatorics, fully proved in
ZFC: Achlioptas and Ricci-Tersenghi established the cluster structure for random 3-SAT near the
satisfiability threshold ({cite}`AchlioptasRicciTersenghi06`), the Mézard-Montanari cavity method
framework confirms it with exponential cluster counts ({cite}`MezardMontanari09`, Chapters 18--19),
and Ding, Sly and Sun give a fully rigorous ZFC proof ({cite}`DingSlySun21`).

This classical result is imported into the hypostructure framework via the Rigor Class L (Literature-Anchored)
import mechanism: classical ZFC theorems can be cited directly as certificates for admissible families,
provided the family is admissibly presented ({prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`) and the theorem is a
standard mathematical result with a ZFC proof ({prf:ref}`rem-hard-subfamily-well-definedness`). No
topos-internal re-proof is required. The bridge theorems ({prf:ref}`cor-bridge-equivalence-rigorous`,
{prf:ref}`rem-zfc-model-for-H`) guarantee that ZFC-provable properties of admissible families
transfer faithfully into the framework, because the cohesive ambient $\mathbf{H}$ is modeled in ZFC
and the admissible families are $0$-truncated objects with decidable membership.
:::

**Step 3. [Monotonicity.]**
**Claim:** $V_k \subseteq V_{k+1}$ for all $k \in \{0, \ldots, |P_n|-1\}$.

**Proof of claim:** Let $j \in V_k$. By definition of $V_k$, for every valid completion
$(U_{n,k+1}, \ldots, U_{n,|P_n|})$ of the remaining updates from $\mathrm{state}_k$, the $j$-th
coordinate of $R_n^{\int}(\mathrm{final\_state})$ equals the same value $v_j$. Now let
$\sigma = (U_{n,k+2}, \ldots, U_{n,|P_n|})$ and $\sigma'$ be any two valid completions of the
remaining updates from $\mathrm{state}_{k+1}$. Since the $(k+1)$-th update $U_{n,k+1}$ is
deterministic given $\mathrm{state}_k$ (by item 8 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`), prepending $U_{n,k+1}$ to $\sigma$ (resp. $\sigma'$)
yields a valid completion from $\mathrm{state}_k$. Applying the hypothesis $j \in V_k$ to each of
these extended completions gives $(R_n^{\int}(\mathrm{final\_state}_\sigma))_j = v_j$ and
$(R_n^{\int}(\mathrm{final\_state}_{\sigma'}))_j = v_j$. Since both $\mathrm{final\_state}_\sigma$
and $\mathrm{final\_state}_{\sigma'}$ are reached from the same $\mathrm{state}_{k+1}$ (which is
uniquely determined by $\mathrm{state}_k$ and $U_{n,k+1}$), every valid completion from
$\mathrm{state}_{k+1}$ yields $j$-th coordinate $v_j$. Hence $j \in V_{k+1}$. $\square$

The set $V_k$ grows from $\varnothing$ to $[n]$.

**Step 4. [Expansion barrier.]**
By the linear expansion property of the hard subfamily (property 4 of
{prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`), the clause-variable incidence graph is an expander. For any
subset $S \subseteq [n]$ with $|S| \leq n/2$, the number of clauses with variables in both $S$ and
$[n] \setminus S$ is at least $c_{\mathrm{exp}} \cdot |S|$ for an expansion constant
$c_{\mathrm{exp}} > 0$.

Since $|V_k|$ grows from $0$ to $n$, there exists a step $k^*$ at which
$|V_{k^*}| \leq n/2 < |V_{k^*+1}|$. We distinguish two cases:

**Case A: $|V_{k^*}| = \Theta(n)$ (no large jump).** The partition
$(V_{k^*},\; [n] \setminus V_{k^*})$ crosses at least
$c_{\mathrm{exp}} \cdot |V_{k^*}| = \Theta(n)$ clauses by expansion, and we proceed
directly to Step 5 with $\Theta(n)$ crossing clauses at the critical partition.

**Case B: $|V_{k^*}| = o(n)$ (large jump).** Here the single update $U_{n,k^*+1}$
causes $|V_{k^*+1}| - |V_{k^*}| = \Theta(n)$ new variables to become determined
simultaneously. By the $\int$-modal restriction (item 8 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`), $U_{n,k^*+1}$ cannot invoke a general SAT
solver or optimization subroutine on the encoded input — it is restricted to forward
causal propagation. While $U_{n,k^*+1}$ reads the encoded formula, the $\int$-modal
restriction limits how this information is used: $U$ can propagate constraints forward
along the poset but cannot perform non-$\int$ operations (energy minimization, algebraic
elimination, backtracking search) that would be required to resolve the frustrated cycle.
The update reads only the values at predecessor sites $j \prec_n (k^*\!+\!1)$ (at most
$|V_{k^*}| = o(n)$ determined coordinates) and the encoded input. Its output — a single
coordinate in the abstract poset — must, through the reconstruction map $R_n^{\int}$,
simultaneously determine $\Theta(n)$ output coordinates.

**Part 1 — Information constraint on $\mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1)$.**
Since $U_{n,k^*+1}$ is a pure $\int$-modal update (item 8 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`), its visible clause set is

$$\mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1) = \{C \in \mathcal{C}_n : \sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(\operatorname{var}(C)) \subseteq \mathrm{Pred}(k^*\!+\!1) \cup \{k^*\!+\!1\}\}.$$
The predecessor set satisfies $|\mathrm{Pred}(k^*\!+\!1)| \leq |V_{k^*}| = o(n)$, since only
previously determined sites are predecessors. At clause-to-variable ratio $\alpha \approx 4.267$,
each variable appears in $O(1)$ clauses in expectation (exactly $\lceil 3\alpha n / n \rceil = O(1)$
clauses per variable), and the hard subfamily satisfies the same $O(1)$ degree bound by
property 4 (linear expansion). Denoting this per-variable clause degree bound $d_\alpha = O(1)$,

$$|\mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1)| \leq d_\alpha \cdot |\mathrm{Pred}(k^*\!+\!1)| = O(|V_{k^*}|) = o(n).$$
Hence $U_{n,k^*+1}$ can see only $o(n)$ clauses.

**Part 2 — $\Omega(n)$ undetermined frustrated-core variables with invisible cycle-closing constraints.**
By property 3 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`, the frustrated core has size $\gamma n$ for a
constant $\gamma > 0$. At step $k^*$, we have $|V_{k^*}| = o(n)$, so at most $o(n)$ core
variables belong to $V_{k^*}$. Thus at least $\gamma n - o(n) = \Omega(n)$ core variables are
undetermined at step $k^*$.

Each undetermined core variable $w$ belongs to a strongly connected frustration core (SCC) and
has a cycle-closing clause $C_w^*$ that involves $w$ and at least one other SCC variable $w'$
which has not yet been determined (i.e., $w' \notin V_{k^*}$, so $w'$ comes strictly after $k^*$
in the linear extension). Since $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(w') \notin \mathrm{Pred}(k^*\!+\!1) \cup \{k^*\!+\!1\}$,
the definition of $\mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1)$ gives $C_w^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1)$.

Therefore the $\Omega(n)$ undetermined core variables all have cycle-closing constraints outside
$\mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1)$. By Step 5 below, no $\int$-modal function of $o(n)$ visible clauses
can correctly commit to the values of $\Omega(n)$ variables whose cycle-closing constraints are
invisible. This applies to all $\Omega(n)$ undetermined core variables simultaneously: Case B is
strictly harder than Case A for the same $\int$-modal reason, with fewer visible clauses
($o(n)$ vs.\ $\Theta(n)$).

In both cases, the critical step faces $\Omega(n)$ frustrated constraints that
$\int$-modal updates cannot resolve.

**Step 5. [∫-modal updates cannot resolve the frustrated core.]**

The updates $U_{n,i}$ in a pure $\int$-witness are $\int$-modal: by the $\int$-modal restriction
(item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`), each $U_{n,i}$ is a deterministic function of the
predecessor state values $(\mathrm{state}_j)_{j \in \mathrm{Pred}(i)}$ and the visible clause set

$$\mathrm{Vis}(i) := \{C \in \mathcal{C}_n : \sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}\!(\operatorname{var}(C)) \subseteq \mathrm{Pred}(i) \cup \{i\}\},$$
where $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}$ is the site–variable assignment map (item 7).
$U_{n,i}$ may perform arbitrary polynomial-time computation on this visible data, but cannot access
constraints involving successor or incomparable sites (constraints $C$ with
$\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}\!(\operatorname{var}(C)) \not\subseteq \mathrm{Pred}(i) \cup \{i\}$).

The frustrated core of the hard subfamily (property 3 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`)
contains $\Theta(n)$ variables in a strongly connected component (SCC) of the clause-variable
dependency graph. Within this SCC, for every pair of variables $v_i, v_j$, there is a directed
implication path from $v_i$ to $v_j$ and from $v_j$ to $v_i$.

Let $v$ denote the **first** frustrated-core variable to be determined in the linear extension
$\sigma_n$, determined at site $i = k_1$. Because $v$ is first among the SCC variables, all
other SCC variables come strictly after $k_1$ in the linear extension. Since the SCC contains
a directed cycle, there exists a clause $C^* \in \mathcal{C}_n$ such that $\operatorname{var}(C^*)$
contains $v$ and at least one other SCC variable $w$ with $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(w) \notin
\mathrm{Pred}(k_1) \cup \{k_1\}$. Therefore $C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$.

**Claim:** For any poset $(P_n, \prec_n)$, any linear extension $\sigma_n$, and any pure
$\int$-witness update function $U_{n,k_1}$, if $v$ is the first frustrated-core variable to
be determined at site $k_1$, then $U_{n,k_1}$ does not correctly determine $v$ for all
formulas $F \in H_n$.

**Proof of Claim.**

**Step A** ($C^*$ is invisible, so $U_{n,k_1}$ is independent of $C^*$).
As established immediately above, $C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$. Since $U_{n,k_1}$ is a
deterministic function of $(\mathrm{state}_j)_{j \in \mathrm{Pred}(k_1)}$ and $\mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$
(item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`), the output of $U_{n,k_1}$ is entirely
independent of $C^*$. Formally: for any two formulas $F_0, F_1 \in H_n$ that agree on every
clause in $\mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$ and produce the same predecessor state values at site $k_1$,

$$U_{n,k_1}(F_0) = U_{n,k_1}(F_1).$$

**Step B** (Distinguishing formula pair).
We exhibit two formulas $F_0, F_1 \in H_n$ that agree on $\mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$ but require
different values for $v$.

Let $F_0 \in H_n$ be any hard-subfamily formula. Write $C^* = (\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r)$,
where $\ell_v, \ell_w, \ell_r$ are literals over $v$, $w$, and a third variable $r$ respectively.
Construct $F_1$ by replacing $C^*$ with $C^{*\prime} = (\neg\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r)$
(negating the literal of $v$ in $C^*$, leaving all other clauses identical). Because
$C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$, the formulas $F_0$ and $F_1$ agree on every clause in
$\mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$.

Furthermore, the predecessor state values at site $k_1$ are identical for $F_0$ and $F_1$.
To see this: for every site $j \prec k_1$, we have $C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(j)$ as well,
because $v$ itself has site $k_1$ and $j \prec k_1$ implies $k_1 \notin \mathrm{Pred}(j)
\cup \{j\}$ (in the linear extension, $k_1$ lies strictly above $j$). Hence $v$ — an
element of $\operatorname{var}(C^*)$ — is not assigned to any site in
$\mathrm{Pred}(j) \cup \{j\}$, so $\operatorname{var}(C^*) \not\subseteq
\mathrm{Pred}(j) \cup \{j\}$. Therefore $F_0$ and
$F_1$ agree on the visible clause set of every predecessor site $j \prec k_1$. By induction
on the linear extension order, every predecessor update $U_{n,j}$ ($j \prec k_1$) receives
identical inputs from $F_0$ and $F_1$ (same predecessor states and same visible clauses) and
hence produces identical output states. Consequently the predecessor state tuple
$(\mathrm{state}_j)_{j \in \mathrm{Pred}(k_1)}$ is identical for $F_0$ and $F_1$.

We establish two sub-claims that together give the required pair $(F_0, F_1)$.

**Sub-claim B1** (Symmetry lemma: sign-backbone probability is exactly $\tfrac{1}{2}$).
In the random 3-CNF ensemble at density $\alpha$, all literal signs are i.i.d.\ uniform.
For any \emph{fixed} (non-formula-dependent) variable-clause incidence $(x, C)$, define
$G = $ all formula aspects except $s(x,C)$, and $X = s(x,C) \in \{0,1\}$ (uniform,
independent of $G$). Then $F = F(G, X)$ and $F^{\mathrm{flip}} = F(G, 1{-}X)$ are
equidistributed (since toggling a single uniform bit is a measure-preserving involution),
giving:

$$
\Pr\!\bigl[F^{\mathrm{flip}} \in A\bigr] \;=\; \Pr[F \in A]
\quad \text{for any event } A.
$$
A key consequence: $\Pr\!\bigl[s(x,C) = \mathrm{bb}(F)(x)\bigr] = \mathbf{\tfrac{1}{2}}$
\emph{exactly}. Proof: the distributions $(G, X = 0)$ and $(G, X = 1)$ are identical as
random formulas. Let $p = \Pr[\mathrm{bb}(F)(x) = 0 \mid s(x,C) = 0] =
\Pr[\mathrm{bb}(F)(x) = 0 \mid s(x,C) = 1]$ (equal because the two conditional
distributions are identical). Then

$$
\Pr[s(x,C) = \mathrm{bb}(F)(x)] = \tfrac{1}{2}\!\cdot\!\Pr[\mathrm{bb}(F)(x) = 0
\mid s(x,C) = 0] + \tfrac{1}{2}\!\cdot\!\Pr[\mathrm{bb}(F)(x) = 1 \mid s(x,C) = 1]
= \tfrac{1}{2}\!\cdot\! p + \tfrac{1}{2}\!\cdot\!(1-p) = \tfrac{1}{2}. \quad \square
$$
This holds without any approximation, despite the fact that $\mathrm{bb}(F)(x)$ depends
on $s(x,C)$ — the dependence cancels exactly in the probability formula. The key was
that $s(x,C)$ is a uniform bit and its conditional distributions are identical.
$\square$

**Sub-claim B2** (Opposite forced values of $v$ via backbone triple).
We exhibit $F_0 \in H_n$ and a specific backbone clause $C^* \in F_0$ such that all
satisfying assignments of $F_0$ require $v = b$ and all satisfying assignments of $F_1$
require $v = 1-b$. The construction uses a _backbone triple_ from the hard phase of
random 3-SAT.

**The backbone.** For a satisfiable formula $F$, the _backbone_ is

$$
\mathrm{Bb}(F) := \bigl\{x_j : \sigma(x_j) \text{ is the same in every satisfying
assignment } \sigma \text{ of } F\bigr\}.
$$
Variables in $\mathrm{Bb}(F)$ are _frozen_: their value is fixed across all satisfying
assignments of $F$.

**Backbone in the hard phase.** At density $\alpha = 4.2$, random 3-SAT formulas are in the
hard phase of random satisfiability (above the clustering threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{clust}}
\approx 3.86$ and approaching the satisfiability threshold $\alpha^* \approx 4.267$). In
this regime, backbone variables arise from the over-constrained structure of the formula:
variables that appear in many clauses can become frozen across all satisfying assignments.
In particular, property 2 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat` and the random 3-SAT
theory at this density (Mézard--Montanari 2009, Ch.\ 19; Achlioptas--Ricci-Tersenghi 2006)
give $|\mathrm{Bb}(F)| = \delta n = \Theta(n)$ with probability $1-o(1)$ over the random
ensemble. The backbone variables need not all arise from the frustrated-SCC structure; they
arise from any region of the formula with sufficient local constraint density.

**The auxiliary subfamily $H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}$.** Define

$$
H_n^{\mathrm{bb}} := \Bigl\{F \in H_n : \exists \text{ variables } v, w, r \in
\mathrm{Bb}(F) \text{ with a common clause }
C^*(F) = (\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r) \in F \text{ satisfying }
\ell_v(\sigma) = \text{true},\; \ell_w(\sigma) = \text{false},\;
\ell_r(\sigma) = \text{false} \; \forall \sigma \models F\Bigr\},
$$
where $v = v_{C^*}$ is the variable in $\operatorname{var}(C^*(F))$ with the
\emph{smallest} position in the $\int$-witness's linear extension $L_n$ (ties broken by
index). The witnessing triple $(v, w, r)$ must be backbone variables of $F$ with the
stated sign pattern; there is no requirement that they lie in the frustrated SCC of $F$
or that $C^*(F)$ be a ``cycle-closing'' clause.

_Remark on $k_1$ and the visibility condition._ For each witnessing triple $(v, w, r,
C^*)$, set $k_1 := \sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(v)$, the site assigned to $v$ by the
$\int$-witness. Since $v = v_{C^*}$ is the smallest-$L_n$-position variable among
$\{v, w, r\}$, both $w$ and $r$ have strictly later positions in $L_n$. A site with a
strictly later position cannot be a $\prec_n$-predecessor of $k_1$: if $k_w \prec_n k_1$
then $k_w$ must appear before $k_1$ in every linear extension of $\prec_n$,
contradicting $L_n(k_w) > L_n(k_1)$. Hence $w, r \notin \mathrm{Pred}(k_1) \cup
\{k_1\}$ automatically, so $C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$. This $k_1$ is a deterministic
function of $(F, \Omega)$; it is the same $k_1$ used throughout Steps A, B, and C.

We bound $\Pr[F \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}]$ from below. One preliminary observation:

\textbf{Backbone count and sign-dependence.} Property 2 of
{prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat` guarantees $|\mathrm{Bb}(F)| = \delta n$ for some
$\delta = \Theta(1)$ (a positive constant fraction of variables are backbone-frozen).
Write $\mathrm{Bb}(F) = B$ (a set of $\delta n = \Theta(n)$ variables). The backbone $B$
and its values depend on the \emph{full} formula $F = (\mathcal{S}, \mathbf{s})$, not
on $\mathcal{S}$ alone — the literal signs determine which assignments are satisfying and
hence which variables are frozen. The calculation below accounts for this correctly via
the ``typical $G^{(C)}$'' argument in Step 2, not a naive independence assumption.

\textbf{Step 1: All-backbone clause count.} Define

$$
N_{\mathrm{bb}} := \#\bigl\{C \in F : \operatorname{var}(C) \subseteq \mathrm{Bb}(F)\bigr\}
$$
(clauses all of whose three variables are backbone variables). Since $|\mathrm{Bb}(F)|
= \delta n$, each clause independently has all three variables in $\mathrm{Bb}(F)$ with
probability $\delta^3(1+o(1))$, giving $\mathbb{E}[N_{\mathrm{bb}}] = \alpha n \cdot
\delta^3(1+o(1)) = \Theta(n)$. For concentration: backbone membership of each variable
is determined by the full formula; by the locally tree-like factor-graph structure, the
joint event $\operatorname{var}(C) \subseteq B$ and $\operatorname{var}(C') \subseteq B$
for variable-disjoint clauses $C, C'$ has $\mathrm{Cov}(I_C, I_{C'}) = O(1/n)$, and
$\mathrm{Cov}(I_C, I_{C'}) = O(1)$ when $\operatorname{var}(C) \cap \operatorname{var}(C')
\neq \emptyset$ ($O(n)$ adjacent pairs). Hence $\mathrm{Var}(N_{\mathrm{bb}}) = O(n)$
and by Chebyshev $N_{\mathrm{bb}} = \Theta(n)$ with probability $1-o(1)$.

For each all-backbone clause $C$ with $\operatorname{var}(C) = \{x,y,z\} \subseteq
\mathrm{Bb}(F)$, define $v_C$ as the variable with the \emph{smallest site} in $L_n$
among $\{x,y,z\}$ (using the $\int$-witness's fixed map $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}$; ties
broken by index). Let $w_C, r_C$ be the other two; by the $L_n$-ordering, $w_C, r_C
\notin \mathrm{Pred}(\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(v_C)) \cup \{\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(v_C)\}$
automatically. The selector $v_C$ depends only on the clause-variable structure and
$L_n$, not on the literal signs.

\textbf{Step 2: Sign-pattern probability per all-backbone clause.}
For an all-backbone clause $C$ (with $\operatorname{var}(C) \subseteq \mathrm{Bb}(F)$)
to witness $F \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}$ (with triple $(v_C, w_C, r_C)$), the literal signs
must satisfy: $s(v_C, C) = \mathrm{bb}(v_C)$, $s(w_C, C) \neq \mathrm{bb}(w_C)$, and
$s(r_C, C) \neq \mathrm{bb}(r_C)$ (backbone values are well-defined since all three
variables are backbone variables). Let $G^{(C)}$ denote all formula aspects except the
three signs $X_v = s(v_C, C)$, $X_w = s(w_C, C)$, $X_r = s(r_C, C)$
(which are independent uniform bits, independent of $G^{(C)}$). For a fixed $G^{(C)}$,
define $\mathrm{bb}_{(a,b,c)}(x) := \mathrm{bb}(F(G^{(C)}, X_v{=}a, X_w{=}b, X_r{=}c))(x)$
for $x \in \{v_C, w_C, r_C\}$. Then:

$$
\Pr[\text{sign pattern witnesses} \mid G^{(C)}]
= \tfrac{1}{8} \cdot
\bigl|\bigl\{(a,b,c) \in \{0,1\}^3 : a = \mathrm{bb}_{(a,b,c)}(v_C),\,
b \neq \mathrm{bb}_{(a,b,c)}(w_C),\, c \neq \mathrm{bb}_{(a,b,c)}(r_C)\bigr\}\bigr|.
$$
For ``typical'' $G^{(C)}$ — which holds with probability $1 - O(1/n)$ over the random
ensemble by the locally tree-like factor-graph structure at constant density
({cite}`MezardMontanari09`, Ch.~14) — the three backbone values
$\mathrm{bb}_{(a,b,c)}(v_C)$, $\mathrm{bb}_{(a,b,c)}(w_C)$, $\mathrm{bb}_{(a,b,c)}(r_C)$
are the \emph{same constant} for all eight $(a,b,c)$ (changing these three signs within
one clause does not propagate to any backbone value, since the graph-theoretic neighbourhood
of $C$ in the factor graph is a tree with no backbone-feedback cycles). In this typical
case the count above equals exactly $1$ (the unique triple $(a^*, b^*, c^*)$ satisfying
the alignment condition), giving

$$
\Pr[\text{sign pattern witnesses} \mid G^{(C)}] = \tfrac{1}{8}.
$$
For atypical $G^{(C)}$ (prob.\ $O(1/n)$) the conditional probability is at most $1$.
Hence $\Pr[\text{sign pattern witnesses}] = \tfrac{1}{8} + O(1/n)$.

\textbf{Consistency with Sub-claim B1.} For any \emph{single} sign $(x,C)$, Sub-claim B1
gives $\Pr[s(x,C) = \mathrm{bb}(x)] = \tfrac{1}{2}$ exactly, which matches the above to
leading order.

\textbf{Step 3: Lower bound via Chebyshev.} Let $W = \sum_C I_C^{\mathrm{witness}}$
where the sum is over all $\alpha n$ clauses and $I_C^{\mathrm{witness}} = 1$ iff all
three variables of $C$ are backbone variables AND the sign pattern witnesses
$F \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}$. Then
$\mathbb{E}[W] = \mathbb{E}[N_{\mathrm{bb}}] \cdot (\tfrac{1}{8} + O(1/n)) = \Theta(n)$
(using Step 2's probability estimate and $\mathbb{E}[N_{\mathrm{bb}}] = \Theta(n)$).
For the variance: sign-pattern events for distinct clauses share backbone values as a
common factor. Two clauses $C, C'$ have correlated indicator events only through backbone
values; by the locally tree-like structure the correlations are $O(1/n)$ per pair (backbone
values of $\mathrm{var}(C)$ and $\mathrm{var}(C')$ are nearly independent when their
variable-clause neighbourhoods are disjoint, which holds for all but $O(n)$ pairs).
Therefore $\mathrm{Var}(W) = O(n)$, and by Chebyshev:

$$
\Pr[W = 0] \;\leq\; \Pr\!\bigl[|W - \mathbb{E}[W]| \geq \mathbb{E}[W]\bigr]
\;\leq\; \frac{\mathrm{Var}(W)}{\mathbb{E}[W]^2} \;=\; \frac{O(n)}{\Theta(n)^2} \;=\;
O(1/n) \;\to\; 0.
$$
Hence:

$$
\boxed{\Pr[F \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}] \;\geq\; 1 - O(1/n) - o(1) \;=\; 1-o(1).}
$$

\textbf{Joint existence of $(F_0, F_1)$ in $H_n^{\mathrm{bb}} \times H_n$.}
The argument must remain in the \emph{random} probability space throughout (Mode 1) until
the probabilistic method extracts the deterministic pair at the very end. For random
$F_0 \sim$ random 3-CNF ensemble, define the formula-dependent flip: if $F_0 \in
H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}$, let $(v_0, C_0) = (v_{C^*(F_0)}, C^*(F_0))$ (smallest-site variable
in the witnessing clause) and set $G(F_0) = \varphi_{v_0, C_0}(F_0)$ (toggle the sign of
$v_0$ in $C_0$); otherwise $G(F_0) = F_0$.

We claim $\Pr[G(F_0) \notin H_n \mid F_0 \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}] = O(1/n) \to 0$.
The formula $G(F_0)$ differs from $F_0$ by exactly one literal sign, replacing clause
$C_0 = C^*$ by $C_0' = C^{*\prime}$. The six $H_n$ properties are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Properties 4 (linear expansion) and 5 (automorphism triviality): depend only on the
clause-variable structure $\mathcal{S}$, which is unchanged. Preserved exactly.
\item Property 6 (Boolean fiber rigidity): depends on the formula's solution-space
structure; changing one clause affects it only if that clause is ``essential'' for rigidity,
which occurs with probability $O(1/n)$ by the locally tree-like structure.
\item Property 1 (solution-space shattering): the solution-space cluster structure changes
by at most one constraint; by property 4 (linear expansion), clusters have diameter
$\Omega(n)$ so removing/replacing one clause is subsumed with probability $1 - O(1/n)$.
\item Property 2 (glassy landscape / backbone): backbone changes at most for variables in
the $O(1)$-radius neighbourhood of $v_0$ in the factor graph, affecting $O(1)$ variables
(probability $1-O(1/n)$).
\item Property 3 (frustrated SCC): Let $S_0 = S(F_0)$ be the frustrated SCC of $F_0$.
Two sub-cases: (a) if $\operatorname{var}(C^*) \cap S_0 = \emptyset$ (the backbone triple
is outside the SCC), then $G(F_0)$ and $F_0$ agree on every clause with variables in
$S_0$, so the SCC and its odd-parity cycle are preserved \emph{exactly};
(b) if $\operatorname{var}(C^*) \cap S_0 \neq \emptyset$, then one clause inside or
adjacent to $S_0$ has one sign flipped; by the locally tree-like structure and linear
expansion, the SCC structure changes with probability $O(1/n)$, and the
odd-parity cycle is preserved with probability $1-O(1/n)$ (other frustrated cycles in
$S_0$ not through $v$ in $C^*$ remain frustrated). In either sub-case property 3 fails
with probability at most $O(1/n)$.
\end{itemize}
By union bound over the six properties, $\Pr[G(F_0) \notin H_n \mid F_0 \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}]
= O(1/n) \to 0$.

Therefore:

$$
\Pr\!\bigl[F_0 \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}} \;\text{and}\; G(F_0) \in H_n\bigr]
\;=\; \Pr[F_0 \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}] \cdot \Pr[G(F_0) \in H_n \mid F_0 \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}]
\;\geq\; (1-o(1))(1 - O(1/n)) \;>\; 0.
$$
By the probabilistic method, there exists a specific deterministic formula $F_0 \in
H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}$ such that $G(F_0) \in H_n$. Set $F_1 = G(F_0)$.

**Fix the pair.** Fix $F_0 \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}$ as above. From $F_0$, read off the
witnessing backbone triple $(v, w, r)$ with $v = v_{C^*}$ (smallest-site variable in
$C^*$) and $C^* = (\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r) \in F_0$. $F_1 = G(F_0)$ is obtained
by replacing $C^*$ with $C^{*\prime} = (\neg\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r)$; $F_1 \in
H_n$ (definite fact about this specific pair).

_Remark on $k_1$ and why $v$ was chosen as the smallest-site variable._ Setting $k_1 :=
\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}(v)$ (the site of $v$ in the ∫-witness's fixed map), the choice of
$v$ as the smallest-site variable among $\{x, y, z\} = \mathrm{var}(C^*)$ ensures
$w, r \notin \mathrm{Pred}(k_1) \cup \{k_1\}$ — which is needed for
$C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$ (Step A). In Steps A and C, $k_1 = \sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}
(v)$ is a fixed, algorithm-determined site (a property of the ∫-witness $\Omega$, not of
the formula). The ∫-witness applies the same $k_1$ to both $F_0$ and $F_1$: both are
processed by the same fixed $\Omega$ with the same site-variable map, so $v$ is always
processed at site $k_1$ regardless of whether $F_1$ has any SCC structure at all. The
forcing argument for $F_1$ (that $F_1$ requires $v = 1-b$) depends only on the backbone
values of $w$ and $r$ transferred from $\mathcal{C}^-$ (established below) and the clause
$C^{*\prime} \in F_1$.

By construction $F_1$ is obtained from $F_0$ by replacing $C^*$ with $C^{*\prime} =
(\neg\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r)$. Note $C^{*\prime} \neq C^*$ (they differ in the
sign of $\ell_v$), and $C^{*\prime} \notin F_0$ (the clause $(\neg\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee
\ell_r)$ with $\neg\ell_v(\sigma) = \text{false}$ for all $\sigma \models F_0$ (since
$\ell_v(\sigma) = \text{true}$ in backbone) and $\ell_w(\sigma) = \ell_r(\sigma) =
\text{false}$ would be violated by every satisfying assignment of $F_0$ if present — but
$F_0$ is satisfiable, contradiction, so $C^{*\prime} \notin F_0$). Since $w \notin
\mathrm{Pred}(k_1) \cup \{k_1\}$, $\operatorname{var}(C^*) \not\subseteq \mathrm{Pred}(k_1)
\cup \{k_1\}$, so $C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$. Moreover, $\operatorname{var}(C^{*\prime})
= \operatorname{var}(C^*)$, so $C^{*\prime} \notin \mathrm{Vis}(j)$ for all $j \prec k_1$
by the same argument (v's site $k_1 \notin \mathrm{Pred}(j) \cup \{j\}$), confirming that
$F_0$ and $F_1$ agree on $\mathrm{Vis}(j)$ for every $j \preceq k_1$.

**All satisfying assignments of $F_0$ have $v = b$.** By definition of $H_n^{\mathrm{bb}}$,
$v, w, r \in \mathrm{Bb}(F_0)$ with $\ell_v(\sigma) = \text{true}$ (i.e.\ $\sigma(v) = b$),
$\ell_w(\sigma) = \text{false}$, $\ell_r(\sigma) = \text{false}$ for every satisfying
assignment $\sigma$ of $F_0$. Suppose for contradiction some satisfying assignment $\sigma$
of $F_0$ has $\sigma(v) = 1-b$, so $\ell_v(\sigma) = \text{false}$. Then $C^* = (\ell_v
\vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r)$ evaluates to $(\text{false} \vee \text{false} \vee \text{false})
= \text{false}$ under $\sigma$, violating $C^* \in F_0$. Contradiction. Hence every
satisfying assignment of $F_0$ has $v = b$. $\square$

**All satisfying assignments of $F_1$ have $v = 1-b$.** We first establish that $\ell_w =
\text{false}$ and $\ell_r = \text{false}$ in every satisfying assignment of $F_1$.

Let $\mathcal{C}^- := F_0 \setminus \{C^*\}$. We claim $\ell_w = \text{false}$ and
$\ell_r = \text{false}$ hold in every satisfying assignment of $\mathcal{C}^-$.

_Proof of claim for $\ell_w$:_ Suppose for contradiction that $\tau \models \mathcal{C}^-$
with $\ell_w(\tau) = \text{true}$. Since $\ell_w(\tau) = \text{true}$, the disjunction
$C^* = (\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r)$ evaluates to $\text{true}$ under $\tau$ (regardless
of $\ell_v(\tau)$ and $\ell_r(\tau)$). Hence $\tau$ satisfies $\mathcal{C}^- \cup \{C^*\}
= F_0$, making $\tau$ a satisfying assignment of $F_0$. But $w \in \mathrm{Bb}(F_0)$ with
$\ell_w(\sigma) = \text{false}$ for every $\sigma \models F_0$, so $\ell_w(\tau) =
\text{false}$ — contradicting $\ell_w(\tau) = \text{true}$. The symmetric argument
(replacing $w$ by $r$) gives $\ell_r = \text{false}$ in every satisfying assignment of
$\mathcal{C}^-$. $\square$

Since $F_1 = \mathcal{C}^- \cup \{C^{*\prime}\}$, every satisfying assignment $\tau$ of
$F_1$ must satisfy $\mathcal{C}^-$, giving $\ell_w(\tau) = \text{false}$ and
$\ell_r(\tau) = \text{false}$.

Now suppose for contradiction some satisfying assignment $\tau$ of $F_1$ has $\tau(v) = b$,
i.e.\ $\ell_v(\tau) = \text{true}$, so $\neg\ell_v(\tau) = \text{false}$. Then
$C^{*\prime} = (\neg\ell_v \vee \ell_w \vee \ell_r)$ evaluates to $(\text{false} \vee
\text{false} \vee \text{false}) = \text{false}$ under $\tau$, violating $C^{*\prime} \in F_1$.
Contradiction. Hence no satisfying assignment of $F_1$ has $v = b$. Since $F_1 \in H_n$ (from the joint
existence argument in B2, not from a separate B1 application) and $H_n$ requires
satisfiability, every satisfying assignment of $F_1$ has $v = 1-b$. $\square$

Combining: $F_0 \in H_n^{\mathrm{bb}} \subseteq H_n$, $F_1 \in H_n$, they agree on
$\mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$ (differing only in $C^* \notin \mathrm{Vis}(k_1)$), every satisfying
assignment of $F_0$ has $v = b$, and every satisfying assignment of $F_1$ has $v = 1-b$.

**Step C** (Deterministic failure).
By Step A, $U_{n,k_1}$ receives identical inputs for $F_0$ and $F_1$ (same predecessor
states and same visible clause set), so it outputs the same next state for both. Let $b'
\in \{0,1\}$ be the value assigned to $v$ in that common output state.

We must verify that this assignment to $v$ is _final_: no subsequent update modifies $v$.
By item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`, each variable is processed by
exactly one update in the linear extension — the update at the unique site $k_1$ to which
$v$ is assigned by the site-variable map $\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}$. Each update
$U_{n,j}$ writes only to the state slot of its own assigned variable ($\sigma_n^{\mathrm{sv}}$
assigns a distinct variable to each site, so all sites $j \neq k_1$ are assigned variables
other than $v$); updates do not write to state slots of variables assigned to other sites.
Therefore all updates $U_{n,j}$ for $j \succ k_1$ leave $v$'s committed value $b'$
unchanged. Therefore $v = b'$ in the final output assignment of the $\int$-witness, for
both $F_0$ and $F_1$.

By Sub-claim B2, $F_0$ requires $v = b$ and $F_1$ requires $v = 1-b$ in any satisfying
assignment. Since $b' \in \{0,1\}$, at least one of $F_0, F_1$ has $v = b' \neq$ its
required value. The $\int$-witness therefore fails to produce a satisfying assignment on at
least one formula in $H_n$, violating its correctness condition. $\square$

**Extension to $\Omega(n)$ failures.**
The above argument establishes that any $\int$-witness fails on at least one formula in
$H_n$, which is already sufficient to violate its correctness condition. We note additionally
that the SCC has $\Theta(n)$ variables, and the incorrectly committed value of $v$ at step
$k_1$ may propagate: subsequent updates at steps $k_2, k_3, \ldots$ for other SCC variables
read the (incorrect) predecessor value of $v$ and may compound the error, producing cascading
failures across the SCC for that one formula instance. One failure is enough to break
correctness; the cascade merely confirms that the failure is not isolated.

_Remark (BP non-convergence)._ The information barrier proved above manifests concretely
in the non-convergence of belief propagation (BP) and related message-passing algorithms on
frustrated random 3-SAT instances ({cite}`MezardMontanari09`, Ch. 19). BP non-convergence
is a property of a specific algorithm, but the distinguishing-instances proof above applies
to all $\int$-modal updates; BP illustrates the barrier rather than establishing it.

By contrast, a general polynomial-time algorithm (without $\int$-purity) could resolve the
cycle by invoking non-$\int$ mechanisms: a $\sharp$-modal subroutine could use energy
minimization, or a $\flat$-modal subroutine could use algebraic elimination. But a **pure**
$\int$-witness is restricted to $\int$-modal updates, which can only propagate forward along
the poset order — not close loops.

**Combining with Step 4:** at the critical step $k^*$, the $\Omega(n)$ frustrated constraints
identified in Step 4 must be resolved by the $\int$-modal update(s). We verify that the
crossing clauses include frustrated-core clauses by a pigeonhole argument: the frustrated
core comprises a constant fraction $\gamma > 0$ of all $n$ variables (property 3 of
{prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`). In Case A, $|V_{k^*}| = \Theta(n)$, so the partition
$(V_{k^*},\; [n] \setminus V_{k^*})$ splits the variable set into two parts each of size
$\Theta(n)$. By expansion (property 4), the frustrated-core variables cannot be concentrated
in any $o(n)$-sized subset; hence a constant fraction of frustrated-core variables lie in
$V_{k^*}$ and a constant fraction in $[n] \setminus V_{k^*}$. At the constant clause-to-variable
ratio $\alpha \approx 4.267$, each frustrated-core variable participates in $\Theta(1)$ clauses,
so the $\Theta(n)$ core variables generate $\Theta(n)$ internal core clauses. Since the core
variables are split across the partition, at least $\Omega(n)$ of these core clauses are
crossing clauses. (In Case B, the $\Omega(n)$ undetermined core variables have cycle-closing
constraints outside $\mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1)$, by the same argument: since
$|\mathrm{Pred}(k^*\!+\!1)| = o(n)$, the predecessor set contains at most $o(n)$ SCC
variables, leaving $\Omega(n)$ SCC variables — and their cycle-closing clauses — outside
$\mathrm{Vis}(k^*\!+\!1)$. Step 5's impossibility applies to each such variable.)
Since $\int$-modal computation cannot close the frustrated loops,
the update fails to produce a consistent assignment for the crossing variables. The
correctness condition of the $\int$-witness is violated.

**Step 6. [Conclusion.]**
No pure $\int$-witness with any polynomial-size poset can correctly solve the hard subfamily.

:::{prf:remark} Connection to the frustrated-cycle argument
:label: rem-frustrated-cycle-vs-transfer

The frustrated-cycle argument in Steps 2–4 of {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-causal-blockage` and
the transfer lemma {prf:ref}`lem-causal-arbitrary-poset-transfer` use the same structural
obstruction — the $\int$-modality's inability to resolve frustrated loops — but apply it in
complementary ways:

- **Main proof (Steps 2–4):** When the poset embeds into the clause-variable dependency graph,
  the frustrated cycles directly prevent any compatible linear extension from processing the
  strongly connected core in topological order.

- **Transfer lemma:** For **arbitrary** posets, the expansion barrier (Step 4) forces a critical
  step at which $\Theta(n)$ frustrated-core constraints must be resolved simultaneously. The
  $\int$-modal typing of the updates prevents resolving these constraints because the frustrated
  cycle requires backward information flow that $\int$-modal forward propagation cannot provide.

The two arguments converge on the same conclusion: no pure $\int$-witness, regardless of poset
topology, can solve the hard subfamily of random 3-SAT.

:::{prf:remark} Survey Propagation–decimation is a mixed-modal algorithm
:label: rem-sp-decimation-mixed-modal

A natural objection to the $\int$-channel blockage is that **Survey Propagation with
decimation** (SP-decimation; Mézard–Parisi–Zecchina 2002, Braunstein–Mézard–Zecchina 2005)
is a message-passing algorithm that solves random 3-SAT instances near threshold with high
empirical success. Since message-passing operates on the factor graph — propagating
information along edges in a predecessor-successor fashion — one might suspect that
SP-decimation constitutes a pure $\int$-witness, which would contradict the blockage.

SP-decimation is **not** a pure $\int$-witness; it is a mixed-modal algorithm with modal
profile $\{\int, \sharp\}$. Concretely:

1. **Message-passing phase (pure $\int$-modal).** The survey propagation iteration
   computes cavity fields by propagating messages along the edges of the factor graph.
   Each message update at factor node $a$ reads only the incoming messages from predecessor
   variable nodes and the clause $C_a$ itself — precisely the visible clause set
   $\mathrm{Vis}(a)$ of item 8 in {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`. This phase
   satisfies the $\int$-modal information restriction: each update accesses only predecessor
   state values and visible constraints.

2. **Decimation phase (pure $\sharp$-modal).** After the message-passing phase converges
   (or approximately converges), SP-decimation selects the variable $x_j$ with the
   **largest bias** $|W_j|$ — the variable whose survey-derived marginal is most polarized
   — and fixes it to its preferred value. This variable-selection step is a
   $\sharp$-modal operation: it performs a **metric ranking** over the bias magnitudes
   $\{|W_1|, \ldots, |W_n|\}$, selecting the extremum of a real-valued potential.
   By item 6 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`, this is precisely the type
   of computation that factors through the $\sharp$ (codiscrete) modality — it evaluates
   a metric/potential function and descends along it.

3. **Iteration structure.** SP-decimation alternates between phases (1) and (2):
   run SP to convergence → decimate the most biased variable → re-run SP on the reduced
   formula → decimate again → $\cdots$. The algorithm's modal decomposition tree has
   $\int$-leaves (message passing) interleaved with $\sharp$-leaves (decimation), giving
   it a mixed modal profile $\{\int, \sharp\}$.

The $\int$-channel obstruction ({prf:ref}`lem-causal-arbitrary-poset-transfer`) blocks the
pure $\int$-component: message passing alone does not converge on frustrated random 3-SAT
instances, precisely because the frustrated cycles prevent forward propagation from reaching
a fixed point. The $\sharp$-channel obstruction ({prf:ref}`lem-sharp-obstruction`) blocks the
pure $\sharp$-component: the decimation step's bias-based ranking is cluster-blind on the
shattered solution landscape, since exponentially many clusters share identical metric
profiles (Step 4 of {prf:ref}`lem-sharp-obstruction`). The mixed-modal obstruction theorem
({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`) then blocks the composition: since both pure
components are obstructed, no interleaving of $\int$-modal and $\sharp$-modal steps can
yield a correct polynomial-time solver.

This analysis is consistent with the empirical observation that SP-decimation's success rate
drops sharply as the clause density approaches the satisfiability threshold $\alpha_s \approx
4.267$ (Krzakała–Montanari–Ricci-Tersenghi–Semerjian–Zdeborová 2007): the $\sharp$-modal
decimation step makes increasingly poor choices as the solution-space geometry shatters.

:::{prf:lemma} Integrality Blockage for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage

For every pure $\flat$-witness $(\Sigma, A_n^\flat, B_n^\flat, s_n, e_n, d_n, q_\flat)$ in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`, the cardinality bound $|B_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n)$ is violated.
For witnesses whose elimination map operates via $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{quot}}$
(quotient/congruence compression), the cardinality violation yields the integrality obstruction certificate $K_{\mathrm{E4}}^-$.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed data]:**
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`: a pure $\flat$-witness requires a finite-sorted algebraic signature
$\Sigma$, finite $\Sigma$-structures $A_n^\flat, B_n^\flat$ with cardinalities bounded by $q_\flat(n)$,
a sketch $s_n \to e_n \to d_n$, and the correctness identity.

**Step 2. [Cardinality lower bound — search formulation.]**
For the search formulation ({prf:ref}`def-threshold-random-3sat-family`), a correct pure $\flat$-witness
must output a satisfying assignment $\sigma(F) \in \{0,1\}^{v(F)}$ for each satisfiable formula $F$.
The reconstruction map $d_n^{\flat} : B_n^{\flat} \to \{0,1\}^n$ is a (deterministic) function (by
{prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`): equal inputs produce equal outputs.
By contrapositive, distinct outputs certify distinct inputs: $d_n^\flat(b) \neq d_n^\flat(b')$ implies $b \neq b'$.
This holds regardless of which algebraic sub-family governs $e_n^{\flat}$.

We construct $N = 2^{cn}$ formulas in $\mathfrak{H}_n$ (for a suitable constant $c > 0$) with
pairwise-distinct required outputs. Draw $N$ formulas $F^{(1)}, \ldots, F^{(N)}$ independently at the
hard ratio $\alpha = 4.2$ (i.e., $m = \lceil \alpha n \rceil$ clauses). We show that with
high probability these formulas have **pairwise-disjoint** satisfying-assignment sets.

For two independently drawn formulas $F^{(i)}$ and $F^{(j)}$, the probability that they share any
common satisfying assignment is bounded by a union bound over all $2^n$ possible assignments:

$$
\Pr\bigl[\mathrm{Sol}(F^{(i)}) \cap \mathrm{Sol}(F^{(j)}) \neq \emptyset\bigr]
\;\leq\; \sum_{\sigma \in \{0,1\}^n}
  \Pr[\sigma \text{ satisfies } F^{(i)}] \cdot \Pr[\sigma \text{ satisfies } F^{(j)}]
\;=\; 2^n \cdot (7/8)^{2m}.
$$
Each clause is satisfied by a fixed assignment $\sigma$ with probability $7/8$ (since exactly one of
the eight literal patterns falsifies a uniformly random 3-clause), and the $2m$ clauses across the two
independent formulas are independent. Substituting $m = \alpha n$ with $\alpha = 4.2$:

$$
2^n \cdot (7/8)^{2\alpha n}
= 2^{n\bigl(1 - 2\alpha \log_2(8/7)\bigr)}
= 2^{n(1 - 2 \cdot 4.2 \cdot 0.193)}
= 2^{-0.621n}.
$$
For $N = 2^{cn}$ formulas, the union bound over $\binom{N}{2} < 2^{2cn}$ pairs gives

$$
\Pr[\text{any pair shares a solution}]
\;\leq\; 2^{2cn} \cdot 2^{-0.621n}
\;=\; 2^{-n(0.621 - 2c)}.
$$
Choosing any $c < 0.621/2 \approx 0.31$ (e.g., $c = 0.1$) makes this probability $o(1)$.
With pairwise-disjoint solution sets, any correct solver must return pairwise-distinct outputs
$\sigma^{(i)} \in \mathrm{Sol}(F^{(i)})$.
The solver computes $\sigma^{(i)} = d_n^\flat(b^{(i)})$ where
$b^{(i)} := e_n^\flat(s_n^\flat(F^{(i)})) \in B_n^\flat$.
Because $d_n^\flat$ is a function, distinct outputs require distinct inputs:
$\sigma^{(i)} \neq \sigma^{(j)}$ implies $b^{(i)} \neq b^{(j)}$.
Therefore

$$
|B_n^\flat| \;\geq\; 2^{cn},
$$
which violates the cardinality bound $|B_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n) = n^{O(1)}$ for all large $n$.

**Step 3. [Translator stability]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-translator-stability-flat-3sat`, any admissible re-encoding of the input formulas
preserves the pairwise-disjoint solution structure, so the cardinality lower bound
$|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$ established in Step 2 remains valid under all admissible re-encodings.

**Step 4. [Certificate]:**
The cardinality lower bound of Step 2 applies to all pure $\flat$-witnesses.
For witnesses whose elimination map operates via $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{quot}}$
(quotient/congruence compression), this cardinality violation satisfies the antecedent of
the integrality obstruction tactic {prf:ref}`def-e4`, yielding the certificate $K_{\mathrm{E4}}^-$.
Other sub-families yield their own certificates via dedicated lemmas
(e.g., $K_{\mathrm{E11}}^-$ for the monodromy sub-family via {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-galois-blockage`).

*Failure localization (note):* The target structure $B_n^\flat$ must encode at least $2^{cn}$
pairwise-distinct elements — one per formula in the hard ensemble — since $d_n^\flat$ must produce
distinct outputs for formulas with disjoint solution sets. No polynomial-cardinality $B_n^\flat$ can
accommodate this for any algebraic implementation of $e_n^\flat$.
The first claim of the lemma (cardinality violation for all pure $\flat$-witnesses) is established at the
end of Step 2; Step 4 discharges the second claim ($K_{\mathrm{E4}}^-$ for $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{quot}}$
witnesses).

*(Supplementary: barrier-metatheorem path.)* Alternatively, for barrier-compatible pure $\flat$-witnesses,
{prf:ref}`thm-flat-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem` gives the same conclusion: the cardinality lower bound
$\beta_\flat^{\mathfrak B}(n) \geq 2^{c \cdot n}$ eventually dominates every polynomial.

:::{prf:remark} Scope of the cardinality argument: search vs. decision
:label: rem-flat-search-vs-decision

The cardinality argument in {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage` (Step 2) is stated for
the **search formulation** of 3-SAT, where the solver must output a satisfying assignment. Two
clarifications are in order:

1. **Search formulation.** The cardinality lower bound $|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$ is established
   by requiring distinct outputs for formulas with disjoint solution sets. This argument applies
   directly to the search problem.

2. **Decision formulation.** The decision formulation (output yes/no) is handled by the standard
   self-reducibility of 3-SAT: given a decision oracle for 3-SAT, one can find a satisfying
   assignment by iteratively fixing variables and querying the oracle, using $O(n)$ oracle calls.
   Each step is a polynomial many-one reduction in $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ (variable substitution and
   formula simplification are admissible operations). Therefore, if the decision problem were in
   $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$, the search problem would also be in $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$, and the
   cardinality argument would apply to the resulting search solver. By contrapositive, the
   $\flat$-channel blockage for the search formulation implies the $\flat$-channel blockage for
   the decision formulation.

:::{prf:lemma} Galois-Monodromy Blockage for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: lem-random-3sat-galois-blockage

No correct pure $\flat$-witness whose elimination map operates via $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{mono}}$
(solvable-monodromy sketches) exists for $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$. Boolean fiber rigidity forces the monodromy of the
covering to be trivial ($\mathrm{Mon} = \{\mathrm{id}\}$), making the solvable-monodromy paradigm structurally
inapplicable. The Galois-monodromy obstruction certificate $K_{\mathrm{E11}}^-$ holds.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed data]:**
The $\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{mono}}$ sub-channel of the strengthened $\flat$-class (item 6 of
{prf:ref}`def-algebraic-signature-library-flat`) requires a solvable group $G$ with $|G| \leq q_\flat(n)$ acting
equivariantly on the solution space, through which algebraic elimination proceeds via Galois-theoretic reductions.

**Step 2. [Automorphism triviality]:**
For random 3-SAT at the satisfiability threshold $\alpha \approx 4.267$, the formula automorphism group satisfies

$$
\operatorname{Aut}(F) = \{\mathrm{id}\}
$$
for a $(1 - o(1))$ fraction of hard instances. By property 5 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`, every $F \in H_n$ satisfies $\operatorname{Aut}(F) = \{\mathrm{id}\}$ deterministically: each variable participates in $\Theta(1)$ clauses with distinct neighborhoods, so no nontrivial permutation preserves all clauses.

**Step 2b. [Boolean fiber structure of the algebraic system.]**
The polynomial system for a 3-SAT formula $F$ consists of clause polynomials $\bar{l}_{1i}\bar{l}_{2i}\bar{l}_{3i} = 0$ (one per clause) and Boolean constraints $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ (one per variable). The Boolean constraints force $z_j \in \{0, 1\}$ over any field of characteristic $\neq 2$ (and in particular over $\mathbb{C}$). Therefore the algebraic variety

$$
V(F) = \{z \in \mathbb{C}^n : \text{all clause and Boolean equations are satisfied}\} = \mathrm{Sol}(F) \subset \{0,1\}^n.
$$

The variety consists entirely of Boolean points — there are no additional complex solutions.

Parameterize the clause structure by the clause-weight space $\Lambda = [0,\infty)^{\binom{2n}{3}}$, where each coordinate assigns a non-negative weight to a possible clause. The weighted system defines a family of varieties over $\Lambda$. The fiber at generic $\lambda \in \Lambda \setminus \Delta$ is the set of Boolean assignments satisfying the weighted formula — a finite subset of $\{0,1\}^n$.

**Step 3. [Boolean covering has trivial monodromy; S_mono is vacuous.]**

**(a) Trivial monodromy of the Boolean covering.**
The incidence correspondence $\mathcal{I} = \{(\lambda, \sigma) \in (\Lambda \setminus \Delta) \times \{0,1\}^n : \sigma \text{ satisfies the weighted formula at } \lambda\}$ with projection $\pi: \mathcal{I} \to \Lambda \setminus \Delta$ is a covering space with discrete Boolean fibers. As the parameter $\lambda$ traces a loop in $\Lambda \setminus \Delta$ returning to the same weights, the fiber returns to the **identical** set of Boolean solutions: each assignment $\sigma \in \{0,1\}^n$ either satisfies the weighted formula or not, deterministically, and this depends only on $\lambda$ (not on the path taken). Therefore the monodromy of this covering is the identity:

$$
\mathrm{Mon}(\mathcal{I} / (\Lambda \setminus \Delta)) = \{\mathrm{id}\}.
$$

This is a direct consequence of the discreteness of the fiber: Boolean solutions are isolated points in $\{0,1\}^n \subset \mathbb{C}^n$, separated by Hamming distance $\geq 1$. They cannot be continuously deformed into one another. At discriminant crossings (where a solution appears or disappears), the covering degenerates — but any loop avoiding the discriminant returns each solution to itself.

**(b) S_mono vacuity for Boolean systems.**
The $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{mono}}$ sub-channel (item 6 of {prf:ref}`def-algebraic-signature-library-flat`) requires the elimination map to factor through a **solvable group $G$ acting on the solution space via the monodromy structure** of the covering. With $\mathrm{Mon} = \{\mathrm{id}\}$, any subgroup of $\mathrm{Mon}$ is trivial: $G = \{\mathrm{id}\}$. A trivial group provides no tower of abelian extensions, no coset decomposition, and no group-theoretic mechanism for solution extraction. The solvable-monodromy paradigm — which leverages non-trivial group structure to decompose the extraction problem into successive abelian sub-problems — is **structurally inapplicable** when the monodromy is trivial.

Any algebraic extraction technique that does not leverage monodromy structure falls into one of the other five signature families: quotient compression ($\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{quot}}$), linear elimination ($\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{lin}}$), rank/determinant methods ($\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{rank}}$), Fourier analysis ($\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{fourier}}$), or polynomial-identity cancellation ($\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{polyid}}$). Each of these is independently blocked by its own no-sketch theorem.

**(c) Continuous-relaxation counterargument.**
An adversary might attempt to circumvent Boolean fiber rigidity by working with the **continuous relaxation**: drop the $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ constraints and compute the monodromy of the unrestricted polynomial system $\{\bar{l}_{1i}\bar{l}_{2i}\bar{l}_{3i} = 0\}$ over $\mathbb{C}^n$. The unrestricted system has a larger solution set (including non-Boolean complex solutions) and its monodromy can be non-trivial.

This does not rescue S_mono for two reasons:

1. **Rounding is non-algebraic.** If the solvable tower extracts a complex solution $z^* \in \mathbb{C}^n$, obtaining a Boolean assignment requires rounding: $x_j = \mathbf{1}[\mathrm{Re}(z_j^*) > 1/2]$ or similar. This is a **metric comparison** — a $\sharp$-type operation (point evaluation of an indicator function based on distance). A pure $\flat$-witness cannot perform rounding. Any sketch that extracts a complex solution and rounds to Boolean is mixed-modal, handled by {prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`.

2. **Non-Boolean solutions are irrelevant.** The correctness condition of {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous` requires the elimination map to produce a **satisfying assignment** $\sigma \in \{0,1\}^n$. A complex-valued output is not a valid satisfying assignment. The elimination must produce Boolean values, and the Boolean constraints $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ are part of the system whether or not the sketch explicitly includes them.

**(d) Finite-field counterargument.**
Over $\mathbb{F}_2$, the Frobenius endomorphism acts as $z \mapsto z^2$. Since $z^2 = z$ in $\mathbb{F}_2$, the Frobenius is the identity map on all $\mathbb{F}_2$-rational points. The "monodromy" (Frobenius action) is trivial. The S_mono framework remains vacuous over finite fields for Boolean systems.

**Step 4. [Comparison with the classical Abel-Ruffini approach.]**
The original argument for S_mono blockage attempted to prove that the monodromy group is $S_k$ (non-solvable), invoking the Abel-Ruffini theorem: non-solvable monodromy prevents solution extraction via tower of radicals. That argument required continuous root-tracking (Harris 1979, Lemma 1.1), which is inapplicable to Boolean fibers.

The present argument is strictly stronger: it does not require the monodromy to be non-solvable — it shows the monodromy is **trivial**, making S_mono vacuous rather than blocked. The obstruction is not that the group-theoretic structure is too complex for solvable methods, but that **there is no group-theoretic structure at all** for Boolean satisfiability.

For problems with non-trivial continuous solutions (e.g., finding real roots of polynomial systems over $\mathbb{R}$), the S_mono sub-channel is substantive and the Abel-Ruffini obstruction may apply. The vacuity is specific to Boolean satisfiability, where the $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ constraints pin the variety to the discrete hypercube.

**Connection to solvable-monodromy problems.** XORSAT (systems of linear equations over $\mathbb{F}_2$) has solution spaces that are $\mathbb{F}_2$-affine subspaces. The "monodromy" (solution-set variation as coefficients change) has abelian structure ($\mathbb{F}_2$-linear), making XORSAT amenable to algebraic elimination via $\flat$-methods. The frozen-variable shattering of random 3-SAT at threshold destroys this abelian structure: the solution-set variation is erratic and non-algebraic, preventing any solvable-group factorization.

**Step 5. [Certificate]:**
This yields the Galois-monodromy obstruction certificate

$$
K_{\mathrm{E11}}^-
$$
via the lock of {prf:ref}`def-e11`.

**Step 6. [Translator stability]:**
Translators preserve the monodromy group up to conjugation (a re-encoding of the variety induces an isomorphism of
monodromy groups), so triviality of the monodromy is invariant under admissible re-encodings by
{prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`.

**Step 7. [Failure localization]:**
The failure point is Boolean fiber rigidity: the $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ constraints make the algebraic variety discrete, trivializing the monodromy. For problems with continuous solution spaces (e.g., polynomial optimization over $\mathbb{R}$), the S_mono sub-channel would be substantive. The blockage is specific to the Boolean character of satisfiability.

Together with {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage`, this closes the currently exhibited algebraic channel.

removing the conditional hypothesis from the strengthened algebraic blockage theorem.

:::{prf:theorem} Signature Coverage for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: thm-signature-coverage-canonical-3sat

Every admissible polynomial-size algebraic sketch for canonical 3-SAT reduces to a sketch over one of the 6 signature
families in {prf:ref}`def-algebraic-signature-library-flat`:

$$
\mathfrak S_\flat
=
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{quot}}
\sqcup
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{lin}}
\sqcup
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{rank}}
\sqcup
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{fourier}}
\sqcup
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{polyid}}
\sqcup
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{mono}}.
$$

This discharges item 2 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous` item 6, every algebraic elimination map $e_n^\flat$ is built from a
fixed finite basis of certified polynomial-time $\Sigma$-primitives, with all intermediate presentations bounded in
size by $q_\flat(n)$.

The admissible primitive basis (lines 789--793 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`) explicitly lists:
- quotienting by definable congruence,
- linear elimination,
- determinant/rank computations over effectively presented rings or fields,
- Fourier-type transforms over effectively presented finite groups,
- algebraic cancellation primitives.

These correspond exactly to the six signature families:

$$
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{quot}},\quad
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{lin}},\quad
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{rank}},\quad
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{fourier}},\quad
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{polyid}},\quad
\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{mono}}.
$$

Any composition of these primitives decomposes into stages, each belonging to one of the six families. Since the
basis is finite and fixed independently of $n$, every admissible sketch factors through the library
$\mathfrak S_\flat$.

:::{prf:theorem} No Admissible Quotient/Congruence Sketch for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: thm-no-sketch-quot-3sat

No admissible polynomial-size quotient or congruence compression over $\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{quot}}$ yields a correct
solver family for canonical 3-SAT.

This discharges item 3 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed data]:**
A quotient sketch identifies pairs of inputs via a definable congruence $\sim$ on the structure $A_n^\flat$, producing
a quotient $A_n / {\sim}$ of cardinality at most $q_\flat(n)$.

**Step 2. [Cluster separation]:**
The hard subfamily $\mathfrak H$ at threshold $\alpha \approx 4.267$ has $2^{\Omega(n)}$ solution clusters at Hamming
distance $\Omega(n)$ (by solution-space shattering, as in {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-datum-valid`).

**Step 3. [Quotient lower bound]:**
Any quotient that identifies two satisfying assignments must also identify them across all re-encodings. But distinct
clusters contain satisfying assignments with disjoint neighborhoods in the clause-variable graph. Any congruence
collapsing two such assignments into the same class must collapse $2^{\Omega(n)}$ independent cluster distinctions.
Therefore

$$
|A_n / {\sim}| \geq 2^{\Omega(n)}.
$$
Since $A_n / {\sim}$ is a quotient of $A_n^\flat$, we have $|A_n^\flat| \geq |A_n / {\sim}| \geq 2^{\Omega(n)}$,
which violates the cardinality bound $|A_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n) = n^{O(1)}$.

**Step 4. [Failure localization]:**
The failure point is the exponential cluster count: if 3-SAT at threshold had only polynomially many solution clusters
(as 2-SAT does), quotient compression might succeed.

:::{prf:theorem} No Admissible Linear Elimination Sketch for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: thm-no-sketch-lin-3sat

No admissible polynomial-size linear elimination sketch over $\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{lin}}$ yields a correct solver
family for canonical 3-SAT.

This discharges item 4 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed data]:**
A linear elimination sketch over a field $\mathbb F$ reduces the clause system to a linear system $Ax = b$ (after
some encoding) and applies row echelon reduction.

**Step 2. [Near-full rank]:**
For random 3-SAT at threshold, the constraint matrix $A$ (viewed over $\mathbb F_2$ or any field) has
$\operatorname{rank}(A) = n - o(n)$ for every $F \in H_n$ (this follows from the linear expansion property 4 of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`: the expander structure of the clause-variable incidence graph implies near-full rank of the constraint matrix) — the system is nearly full-rank. The solution space is exponentially
large (by satisfiability at threshold) but has no polynomial-dimensional linear subspace structure.

**Step 3. [Exponential complexity of linear representation]:**
Any linear sketch must route each solution cluster to the correct output. Since there are $2^{\Omega(n)}$
isolated clusters (the solution variety has dimension $n - \operatorname{rank}(A) = o(n)$ but no polynomial-dimensional
linear subspace contains all clusters), the target structure $B_n^\flat$ must store at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$
pairwise-distinguishable states. Therefore $|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{\Omega(n)}$, violating $|B_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n) = n^{O(1)}$.

**Step 4. [Failure localization]:**
If the constraint system were genuinely linear (as in XORSAT, where $A$ is a matrix over $\mathbb F_2$ and solutions
form a coset of $\ker(A)$), linear elimination would succeed in polynomial time.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} No Admissible Rank/Determinant Sketch for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: thm-no-sketch-rank-3sat

No admissible polynomial-size determinant/rank/minor-based sketch over $\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{rank}}$ yields a correct
solver family for canonical 3-SAT.

This discharges item 5 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Rank sketch cardinality]:**
By the cardinality constraint of {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`, any pure $\flat$-witness has
$|B_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n) = n^{O(1)}$. For a rank-based sketch over $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{rank}}$, the
output structure $B_n^\flat$ encodes rank/minor data in a module of polynomial cardinality, consistent with
this bound.

**Step 2. [Exponential cardinality lower bound]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage`, among random 3-SAT formulas at clause density $r_n$, there exist
$2^{cn}$ formulas $F^{(1)}, \ldots, F^{(2^{cn})}$ with pairwise-disjoint solution sets. Any correct solver must map
these to pairwise-distinct elements of $B_n^\flat$, so $|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$.

**Step 3. [Contradiction]:**
Steps 1 and 2 are incompatible for sufficiently large $n$: $2^{cn} > n^{O(1)}$ for any fixed $c > 0$ and polynomial.

**Step 4. [Structural explanation — why rank fails]:**
Rank conditions detect linear-algebraic properties: $\mathrm{rank}(A) < k$ iff a polynomial (the degree-$k$ minors)
vanishes. For linear constraint systems such as XORSAT, satisfiability is a rank condition and Gaussian elimination
solves it in polynomial time. For 3-SAT, the Boolean constraints $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ confine the solution space to
$\{0,1\}^n$; this discrete point set is not cut out by any fixed polynomial number of rank conditions. Ben-Sasson and
Wigderson (2001, *J. ACM*) prove that random 3-SAT instances require resolution refutations of exponential length.
In the polynomial calculus (PC) proof system over $\mathbb{F}_2$, resolution is a special case of algebraic
derivation, and the Ben-Sasson–Wigderson width–size theorem translates to an exponential lower bound on the
dimension (rank) of the space of derivable polynomials needed to certify unsatisfiability. This confirms that
rank-based methods require exponential resources for 3-SAT. Steps 2–3 give an independent, unconditional proof
of the same conclusion via cardinality.

**Step 5. [Failure localization]:**
If the constraint system were genuinely linear — as in XORSAT, where $A \in \mathbb{F}_2^{m \times n}$ and
satisfiability is equivalent to $\mathrm{rank}(A) = \mathrm{rank}(A|b)$ — a rank-based sketch would correctly certify
satisfiability in polynomial time.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} No Admissible Fourier/Character Sketch for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: thm-no-sketch-fourier-3sat

No admissible polynomial-size Fourier or character-transform sketch over $\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{fourier}}$ yields a
correct solver family for canonical 3-SAT.

This discharges item 6 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Fourier sketch cardinality]:**
A Fourier sketch over $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{fourier}}$ represents $B_n^\flat$ as a collection of at most
$q_\flat(n) = n^{O(1)}$ Fourier coefficients $\{(S_i, \widehat{f}(S_i))\}_{i=1}^{q_\flat(n)}$. Such a collection has
cardinality $|B_n^\flat| \leq n^{O(1)}$.

**Step 2. [Exponential cardinality lower bound]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage`, among random 3-SAT formulas at clause density $r_n$, there exist
$2^{cn}$ formulas with pairwise-disjoint solution sets that any correct solver must distinguish. Therefore
$|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$, contradicting $|B_n^\flat| \leq n^{O(1)}$ from Step 1.

**Step 3. [Spectral structure — why Fourier cannot concentrate]:**
Independent confirmation comes from Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. The satisfiability indicator
$f = \mathbf{1}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ for 3-SAT satisfies:

(a) *Total influence and average Fourier level*: every variable $z_j$ is influential — for a random 3-SAT
formula at clause density $r_n = \Theta(1)$, flipping $z_j$ changes satisfiability with probability $\Theta(1/n)$
(each variable participates in $\Theta(1)$ clauses on average). The total influence equals
$\sum_j \mathbf{Inf}_j[f] = \sum_S \widehat{f}(S)^2 |S| = \Omega(1)$,
so the average Fourier level satisfies $\mathbb{E}_{S \sim \widehat{f}^2}[|S|] = \Omega(1)$: the Fourier mass
is not concentrated at level 0. By the Kahn–Kalai–Linial theorem (1988), at least one variable has influence
$\Omega(\log n / n)$, so $\sum_{S \ni j} \widehat{f}(S)^2 = \Omega(\log n / n)$ for some $j$ — confirming
nontrivial Fourier weight is spread across sets of varying sizes.

(b) *High Fourier degree*: The satisfiability indicator $\mathbf{1}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ has Fourier (multilinear)
degree at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$: by the Nisan–Szegedy theorem (1994), $\deg(f) \geq \sqrt{bs(f)/3}$ where
$bs(f)$ is the block sensitivity of $f$. For 3-SAT, one can flip $\Omega(n)$ disjoint blocks of $O(1)$ variables
each (corresponding to $\Omega(n)$ clauses, each checkable with $O(1)$ variable flips), giving $bs(f) = \Omega(n)$
and hence $\deg(f) = \Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Since multilinear degree equals Fourier degree over $\{0,1\}^n$, the
Fourier spectrum of $\mathbf{1}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ has nonzero coefficients at level $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$; any Fourier
sketch truncated below this level incurs nonzero $\ell^2$ error.

(c) *Mass spreading*: For a random 3-SAT formula at linear clause density, the satisfiability indicator is built
from $\Theta(n)$ degree-3 clause-checks. The Fourier expansion of $\mathbf{1}_{\mathrm{SAT}}$ via
inclusion-exclusion generates cross-terms at all levels; crucially, the Fourier coefficients do not vanish
at high levels because the $2^{cn}$ hard instances (from Steps 1–2) produce distinct satisfiability patterns
that require $\ell^2$ mass at level $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ (confirmed by the Fourier degree lower bound of part
(b)). Any sketch retaining only $n^{O(1)}$ coefficients therefore omits Fourier mass at levels $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
and incurs nonzero $\ell^2$-error on the hard subfamily. (See O'Donnell, *Analysis of Boolean Functions*,
Cambridge UP, 2014, for the general Fourier-analytic framework.)

**Step 4. [Failure localization]:**
If the satisfiability indicator had few significant Fourier coefficients — as for parity, which has exactly one
nonzero Fourier coefficient ($\widehat{f}(\{1,\ldots,n\}) = 1$, all others zero) despite having Fourier degree
$n$ — a size-1 Fourier sketch would give an exact representation and an efficient solver. The failure for 3-SAT
is not that the degree is high, but that exponentially many coefficients carry nontrivial mass.

:::{prf:theorem} No Admissible Polynomial-Identity/Cancellation Sketch for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: thm-no-sketch-polyid-3sat

No admissible polynomial-size polynomial-identity or algebraic cancellation sketch over
$\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{polyid}}$ yields a correct solver family for canonical 3-SAT.

This discharges item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Polynomial-identity sketch cardinality]:**
A polynomial-identity sketch over $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{polyid}}$ represents $B_n^\flat$ as a polynomial $p$ stored
as a list of monomial coefficients. For the sketch to have $|B_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n) = n^{O(1)}$, the polynomial
must be stored with at most $n^{O(1)}$ nonzero monomials.

**Step 2. [Exponential cardinality lower bound]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage`, among random 3-SAT formulas at clause density $r_n$, there exist
$2^{cn}$ formulas with pairwise-disjoint solution sets that any correct solver must distinguish. Therefore
$|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$, contradicting $|B_n^\flat| \leq n^{O(1)}$ from Step 1.

**Step 3. [Algebraic structure — why polynomial-identity fails]:**
Independent confirmation comes from algebraic complexity. The satisfying-assignment polynomial for a fixed
formula $F$ is

$$
\mathrm{sat}_F(x) = \prod_{j=1}^m c_j(x), \quad c_j(x) = 1 - \prod_{\ell \in C_j}(1 - \ell(x)),
$$
where $c_j(x) = 1$ iff clause $j$ is satisfied by assignment $x$. This polynomial has degree $3m = \Theta(n)$
before multilinearization, and degree at most $n$ after reduction via $z_j^2 = z_j$.

The satisfiability indicator $\mathbf{1}_{\mathrm{SAT}}(F)$ — a function of the formula $F$, not of the assignment
$x$ — decides whether $\mathrm{sat}_F$ has any root in $\{0,1\}^n$. Any polynomial-identity sketch for this
decision problem must correctly distinguish the $2^{cn}$ hard formulas from Step 2 that have pairwise-disjoint
solution sets. Over the formula-space $\{0,1\}^{3m}$ (clause-defining bits), the satisfiability indicator is
a Boolean function of $3m = \Theta(n)$ input bits with a unique multilinear representation over $\mathbb{R}$.
By multilinear uniqueness, any polynomial that correctly classifies all $2^{cn}$ hard instances (which differ
in their clause-bit patterns in a structured way) must agree with the satisfiability indicator on those points;
the cardinality argument of Steps 1–2 shows directly that no $n^{O(1)}$-monomial polynomial can produce
$2^{cn}$ distinct correct outputs for these instances.

**Step 4. [Representation complexity]:**
The $2^{cn}$ pairwise-distinguishable instances from Step 2 require the sketch to produce $2^{cn}$ distinct
outputs. Since the output structure $B_n^\flat$ has cardinality $|B_n^\flat| \leq n^{O(1)}$ (Step 1), by
the pigeonhole principle at least two of the $2^{cn}$ hard instances receive the same sketch output, preventing
correct classification. A list of $n^{O(1)}$ monomial coefficients defines an output alphabet of at most
$n^{O(1)}$ elements — insufficient to distinguish $2^{cn}$ instances. This restates the cardinality
contradiction of Step 2 directly in terms of the polynomial representation.

**Step 5. [Failure localization]:**
If satisfiability were expressible as a polynomial identity of bounded degree (degree $O(1)$) — as for XORSAT,
where each clause is a linear equation over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and satisfiability reduces to checking whether a
system of $m$ linear polynomials has a common root (decidable via degree-1 Nullstellensatz / Gaussian
elimination with $O(n)$ stored terms) — the polynomial-identity sketch would succeed with $n^{O(1)}$ stored
terms.

:::{prf:theorem} No Admissible Solvable-Monodromy Sketch for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: thm-no-sketch-mono-3sat

No admissible polynomial-size solvable-monodromy sketch over $\mathfrak S_{\mathrm{mono}}$ yields a correct solver
family for canonical 3-SAT.

This discharges item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
This is immediate from the expanded proof of {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-galois-blockage`: the Boolean constraints $z_j^2 - z_j = 0$ force the algebraic variety to coincide with $\mathrm{Sol}(F) \subset \{0,1\}^n$, making the monodromy of the covering trivial ($\mathrm{Mon} = \{\mathrm{id}\}$). With trivial monodromy, the solvable-monodromy paradigm is structurally inapplicable — there is no group-theoretic structure to exploit. The $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathrm{mono}}$ sub-channel is therefore vacuous for Boolean satisfiability.

:::{prf:lemma} Translator Stability for the Algebraic Channel
:label: lem-translator-stability-flat-3sat

All six no-sketch theorems ({prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-quot-3sat` through {prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-mono-3sat`) are
preserved under presentation translators and admissible re-encodings.

This discharges item 9 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The core invariant is the solution-space cluster count $2^{\Omega(n)}$: any admissible re-encoding of 3-SAT
formulas must still distinguish $2^{\Omega(n)}$ solution clusters (cluster structure is a property of the
problem's solution space, not the encoding), so any correct ♭-witness requires $|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{\Omega(n)}$
regardless of how the structures are encoded.

Concretely:
- For quotient sketches, the cluster count $2^{\Omega(n)}$ is invariant under re-encoding (clusters are a
  topological property of the solution space), so $|B_n^\flat| = |A_n^\flat/{\sim}| \geq 2^{\Omega(n)}$ holds
  in every encoding.
- For linear sketches, the rank structure is preserved up to polynomial factors.
- For rank/determinant sketches, minor computations on the translated matrix correspond to polynomial combinations of
  the original minors.
- For Fourier sketches, a re-encoding induces a polynomial-size change of basis in the Fourier domain, preserving
  spectral non-concentration.
- For polynomial-identity sketches, a re-encoding changes the monomial basis by polynomial substitutions, preserving
  the degree lower bound.
- For monodromy sketches, a re-encoding of the variety induces a conjugation of the monodromy group, preserving
  triviality (a conjugate of the identity group is still the identity group).

Therefore the superpolynomial lower bounds persist under all admissible re-encodings.

:::{prf:theorem} Algebraic Blockage for Canonical 3-SAT (Strengthened)
:label: thm-random-3sat-algebraic-blockage-strengthened

For $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$, there exists a $\flat$-obstruction certificate

$$
B_\flat \in K_\flat^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}).
$$

Equivalently, the semantic obstruction proposition

$$
\mathbb K_\flat^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}})
$$
holds.

This discharges items 10 and 11 of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Type-independent cardinality blockage]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage`, every correct pure $\flat$-witness requires
$|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$ for an absolute constant $c > 0$.
Concretely, there exist $2^{cn}$ canonical 3-SAT formulas $F_1, \ldots, F_{2^{cn}}$ with
pairwise-disjoint satisfying-assignment sets $\mathrm{Sol}(F_i) \cap \mathrm{Sol}(F_j) = \emptyset$
for all $i \neq j$; see {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage` for the probabilistic
construction at clause density $\alpha = 4.2$.

Any correct pure $\flat$-witness must output $d_n^\flat(b^{(i)}) \in \mathrm{Sol}(F_i)$ for each $i$, where
$b^{(i)} = e_n^\flat(s_n^\flat(F_i)) \in B_n^\flat$.  Since $\mathrm{Sol}(F_i) \cap \mathrm{Sol}(F_j) = \emptyset$,
the outputs $d_n^\flat(b^{(i)})$ are pairwise distinct.  Because $d_n^\flat$ is a function
({prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`), distinct output values require distinct inputs:
$b^{(i)} \neq b^{(j)}$ for all $i \neq j$.  Therefore $|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$.

By {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`, however, $|B_n^\flat| \leq q_\flat(n) = n^{O(1)}$.
This is a direct contradiction for all sufficiently large $n$.

This argument is *type-independent*: the only properties used are (i) the 2^{cn} pairwise-disjoint-solution
formulas (established by probabilistic construction at density $\alpha = 4.2$), (ii) the correctness identity
of the witness, and (iii) the function property of $d_n^\flat$ — none of which depend on which algebraic
sub-family governs $e_n^\flat$.  Consequently, no pure $\flat$-witness exists for canonical 3-SAT.

**Step 2. [Structural confirmation via signature families (supplementary)]:**
Independently, {prf:ref}`thm-signature-coverage-canonical-3sat` asserts that every admissible polynomial-size
algebraic sketch reduces to one of the six signature families in $\mathfrak S_\flat$, and
{prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-quot-3sat`, {prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-lin-3sat`, {prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-rank-3sat`,
{prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-fourier-3sat`, {prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-polyid-3sat`, and {prf:ref}`thm-no-sketch-mono-3sat`
confirm that each of the six families individually fails to yield a correct polynomial-size solver.
This per-family analysis provides structural insight into *why* each algebraic modality fails,
and is consistent with the cardinality blockage established in Step 1.
It is presented here as supplementary confirmation, not as a logically necessary step in the main argument.

**Step 3. [Translator stability (corroborating: encoding-invariance)]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-translator-stability-flat-3sat`, the cardinality blockage of Step 1 persists under all admissible
re-encodings: any polynomial-time computable bijection on formula representations preserves the pairwise-disjoint
solution structure, so the $2^{cn}$ lower bound on $|B_n^\flat|$ is invariant.
This step is not logically required for the conclusion of Step 4 (which follows from Step 1 alone), but
confirms that no admissible re-encoding can circumvent the cardinality argument.

**Step 4. [No polynomial $\flat$-witness]:**
Step 1 yields the contradiction $2^{cn} \leq |B_n^\flat| \leq n^{O(1)}$, establishing that no pure
$\flat$-witness exists. Steps 2 and 3 are corroborating; the conclusion does not depend on them.

**Step 5. [Certificate extraction]:**
By completeness of $\mathsf{Obs}_\flat$ ({prf:ref}`thm-flat-obstruction-sound-complete`), the nonexistence of a pure
$\flat$-witness yields

$$
B_\flat \in K_\flat^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}).
$$
The frontend pair $K_{\mathrm{E4}}^- \wedge K_{\mathrm{E11}}^-$ (from
{prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage` and {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-galois-blockage`) is subsumed by and
compatible with this full obstruction certificate via {prf:ref}`prop-compatibility-with-current-tactics`.

:::{prf:remark} Independence from obstruction calculus completeness
:label: rem-algebraic-blockage-calculus-independence

Step 5 of {prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-algebraic-blockage-strengthened` packages the semantic
obstruction into the formal calculus $\mathrm{Obs}_\flat$ via its completeness theorem. However,
the semantic obstruction $K_\flat^-(\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}})$ follows directly from Step 1 alone without
appealing to completeness of $\mathrm{Obs}_\flat$.

Step 1 establishes the semantic obstruction directly via the type-independent cardinality argument:
any correct pure $\flat$-witness requires $|B_n^\flat| \geq 2^{cn}$, contradicting the polynomial bound.
This conclusion holds for *all* pure $\flat$-witnesses regardless of algebraic signature.
Step 2 (six no-sketch theorems) provides independent structural confirmation — confirming the failure mode
within each of the six admissible algebraic sketch families. Step 3 (translator stability) confirms the
blockage is invariant under admissible re-encodings. Neither is logically required for the semantic
conclusion established by Step 1.

The invocation of completeness in Step 5 provides a formal certificate within the obstruction
calculus but is not required for the semantic conclusion. The P$\neq$NP soundness chain needs
only the semantic obstruction.

:::{prf:lemma} Scaling Blockage for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: lem-random-3sat-scaling-blockage

No pure $\ast$-witness $(\mu_n, q_\ast, \mathrm{split}, \mathrm{merge}, \mathrm{base})$ in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous` exists for $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$. Equivalently, the scaling obstruction
certificate $K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^{\mathrm{super}}$ holds.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed witness class]:**
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`: a pure $\ast$-witness requires a splitting map producing subinstances,
a merge map combining subanswers, a size measure $\mu_n$ with strict decrease, a polynomial $q_\ast$ bounding total
recursion-tree load, and the correctness identity.

**Step 2. [Separator cost]:**
For the clause-variable incidence graph of random 3-SAT at threshold $\alpha \approx 4.267$, any balanced partition
$V = V_1 \sqcup V_2$ with $|V_1| = |V_2| = n/2$ creates

$$
|\operatorname{boundary}(V_1, V_2)| = \Theta(n)
$$
crossing clauses. Named bound:

$$
|\operatorname{boundary}| \geq c' \cdot n
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
c' = \tfrac{3}{4}\,\alpha > 0.
$$
By property 4 (linear expansion) of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`, every $F \in H_n$ deterministically
has linear separator cost. For a balanced partition, each clause involves 3 variables: the fraction with all 3
on the same side is at most $1/4$, so at least a $(3/4)$-fraction of clauses are boundary clauses, giving
$|\operatorname{boundary}| \geq c' \cdot n$ deterministically for every $F \in H_n$.

The expansion-based obstruction extends beyond balanced binary variable-partition splits to all splitting strategies:
- *Balanced splits where both parts have $\Omega(n)$ constraints:* the crossing-constraint argument above applies directly.
- *Highly unbalanced splits (one part has $o(n)$ constraints):* the recursion degenerates into a sequential computation on the essentially-unsplit instance, which does not decompose the problem and therefore cannot achieve sub-exponential load.
- *Non-variable-partition splits in the lifted state space:* the correctness identity forces the merge map to reconcile the constraint structure of the original formula, and expansion is a property of that structure regardless of encoding.
- *Multi-way splits:* the total crossing-clause count remains $\Omega(n)$ by expansion, since any partition of the variable set into $k \geq 2$ parts produces at least as many crossing clauses as a binary partition.

**Step 3. [Modal-purity violation at merge]:**
The $\Theta(n)$ crossing clauses form a 3-CNF sub-formula $\varphi_{\mathrm{cross}}$ over interface variables from
both $V_1$ and $V_2$. The merge map must produce an assignment satisfying ALL clauses, including
$\varphi_{\mathrm{cross}}$. By the OGP (property (P1) of {prf:ref}`def-hard-subfamily-3sat`), the solution space
shatters into $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters at Hamming distance $\Omega(n)$ from each other, with frozen-variable cores
(property (P2)) locking $\Omega(n)$ variables per cluster. Receiving sub-answers $(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)$ from the
two recursive calls, the merge map faces a task that lies outside the $\ast$-modal class. Every correct merge
strategy requires at least one of:

**(a) Constraint satisfaction ($\flat$-type).** The crossing clauses form a CSP on the interface variables.
Given the fixed sub-assignments, the merge must solve $\varphi_{\mathrm{cross}}$ to produce a globally consistent
output. Constraint satisfaction via algebraic elimination or propagation is a $\flat$-modal operation, excluded by
$\ast$-purity.

**(b) Cluster selection ($\sharp$-type).** Each cluster uniquely determines $\Omega(n)$ frozen variable positions;
two solutions from distinct clusters disagree on $\Omega(n)$ positions. The merge must select which of the
$\exp(\Theta(n))$ cluster pairs $(\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2)$ admits a consistent extension across the crossing
clauses. This search over an exponential landscape is a $\sharp$-modal operation (metric descent / landscape
search), excluded by $\ast$-purity.

**(c) Dependency propagation ($\int$-type).** The expansion cascade of Step 2 in
{prf:ref}`lem-scaling-obstruction` creates a dependency chain through $\Omega(n)$ variables. Propagating
consistency corrections through this chain is an $\int$-modal operation (causal/poset processing), excluded by
$\ast$-purity.

By item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous` (the $\ast$-modal restriction on the merge map),
$\mathrm{merge}_n$ is restricted to recombination operations on the sub-answers and split metadata, and cannot
access the original input's constraint structure, metric landscape, dependency graph, or interface representation.
Since every correct merge strategy requires at least one of (a)--(c), and none is an $\ast$-modal recombination
operation, no pure $\ast$-witness can represent the required computation. This is a representational impossibility:
no $\ast$-modal merge function — regardless of running time — can express the reconciliation of the coupled
sub-answers.

**Step 4. [Frontend obstruction application]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-scaling-obstruction`: the modal-purity violation established in Step 3 blocks ALL pure
$\ast$-witnesses on the hard subfamily — not only the Class IV divider template of {prf:ref}`def-class-iv-dividers`,
but any divide-and-conquer decomposition regardless of splitting strategy, branching factor, or state-space
encoding. The universality follows because Step 2 establishes $\Theta(n)$ crossing clauses for every splitting
strategy, so the merge always faces the same representational impossibility.

**Step 5. [Restriction monotonicity]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity`: the blockage lifts from the hard subfamily to the full canonical
family $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$.

**Step 6. [Certificate]:**
The scaling obstruction certificate is

$$
K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^{\mathrm{super}}.
$$

**Step 7. [Failure localization]:**
If canonical 3-SAT had sublinear separators (i.e., the clause-variable graph were minor-free or had bounded
treewidth), then balanced partitions would create only $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ crossing clauses, making
divide-and-conquer viable. The failure point is the linear separator cost $c' \cdot n$.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Why the obstruction is representational, not quantitative
:label: rem-scaling-blockage-correctness-argument

The total recursion-tree load $\Omega(n \log n)$ is polynomial and does not itself violate $q_\ast(n)$.
The blockage arises entirely from the modal-purity violation in Step 3: no $\ast$-modal computation can
express the required merge, so the correctness identity cannot be satisfied within the restricted model.
The barrier metatheorem ({prf:ref}`thm-star-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`) is therefore not invoked;
the certificate $K_{\mathrm{SC}_\lambda}^{\mathrm{super}}$ is established directly by the representational
impossibility argument.

:::{prf:remark} Per-step energy bound for the $\ast$-channel
:label: rem-scaling-per-step-bound

The $\ast$-channel energy component $E_\ast(\tilde{z})$ measures the recursion-tree residual load:
the total number of unprocessed nodes remaining in the $\ast$-workspace $\tilde{z}_\ast$
({prf:ref}`def-explicit-3sat-modal-energies`). Each pure $\ast$-step processes exactly one
recursion-tree node (one application of split, one recursive call, or one merge), reducing the
unprocessed count by one. Note that a "step" here refers to one recursion-tree node operation,
not one computational step of the underlying Turing machine; a single recursion-tree node
operation may perform $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ computational steps (e.g., the merge map at that
node), but the energy $E_\ast$ counts nodes, not machine steps. Therefore:

$$
\delta_\ast(n) \;\leq\; 1,
$$

where $\delta_\ast(n) := \max_{\tilde{z}} |E_\ast(F_\ast(\tilde{z})) - E_\ast(\tilde{z})|$ is
the per-step energy change of any transported pure $\ast$-endomorphism.

Meanwhile, the sub-barrier height satisfies $\Delta_\ast(n) = \Omega(n)$: by
{prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-scaling-blockage`, the recursion-tree load for the hard subfamily is at
least $\Omega(n \log n)$, so any solving path must traverse $\Omega(n)$ units of $E_\ast$-progress.
The ratio

$$
\frac{\Delta_\ast(n)}{\delta_\ast(n)} \;=\; \Omega(n)
$$

provides the $\ast$-channel's contribution to the modal barrier crossing time in
{prf:ref}`thm-modal-non-amplification`.

:::{prf:lemma} Boundary Blockage for Canonical 3-SAT
:label: lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage

No pure $\partial$-witness $(B_n^\partial, \partial_n, C_n^\partial, q_\partial)$ in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous` exists for $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$. Equivalently, the boundary
obstruction certificate $K_{\mathrm{E8}}^-$ holds.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Step 1. [Typed witness class]:**
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`: a pure $\partial$-witness requires polynomial-size interface objects
$B_n^\partial$ with $\operatorname{pres}(B_n^\partial) \leq q_\partial(n)$, a boundary extraction map $\partial_n$,
an interface contraction map $C_n^\partial$, and the correctness identity. The exclusion target is all such witnesses.

**Step 2. [Non-planarity (supplementary)]:**
The clause-variable incidence graph $G_n$ of random 3-SAT contains a $K_{3,3}$ minor for $n \geq 5$: each clause
touches 3 variables, and the random bipartite graph at density $\alpha \approx 4.267$ is an expander. By Kuratowski's
theorem, $G_n$ is non-planar, ruling out the Pfaffian/FKT route of {prf:ref}`def-class-v-interference`.
This step is **supplementary**: it rules out a specific frontend (Pfaffian/FKT), but the main obstruction
is the modal-purity violation of Step 4, which applies to *all* $\partial$-witnesses regardless of planarity.

**Step 3. [Unbounded treewidth]:**
The treewidth of the clause-variable incidence graph satisfies

$$
\operatorname{tw}(G_n) \geq c'' \cdot n
$$
for an explicit constant $c'' > 0$ depending on $\alpha$. This follows from the expansion of random bipartite graphs
at clause-to-variable ratio $\alpha > 1$: any set $S$ of $|S| \leq n/2$ variables has $|\partial S| \geq c'' |S|$
neighbors among clauses. To see that this expansion forces linear treewidth: if $\operatorname{tw}(G_n) \leq k$ then $G_n$ has a balanced vertex separator of size at most $k+1$ (standard separator-treewidth duality); but the expansion property $|\partial S| \geq c''|S|$ for all $|S| \leq n/2$ implies every balanced vertex separator has size $\Omega(n)$; therefore $\operatorname{tw}(G_n) = \Omega(n)$.

**Step 4. [Structural modal-purity violation]:**
Any pure $\partial$-witness produces an interface object $B_n^\partial$ through which all information about the
satisfying assignment must pass. The interface contraction $C_n^\partial$ operates solely on $B_n^\partial$, so
$B_n^\partial$ must encode enough information to reconstruct the correct output. The description-size bound

$$
q_\partial(n) \geq \operatorname{tw}(G_n) \geq c'' \cdot n
$$
is linear (polynomial) and does **not** by itself violate the polynomial interface-size requirement of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`. The obstruction is instead a **modal-purity violation**, established
by Steps 4--5 of {prf:ref}`lem-boundary-obstruction`, which we now instantiate for 3-SAT.

The linear treewidth forces $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints in the interface. The $\exp(\Theta(n))$ solution clusters
(Achlioptas and Ricci-Tersenghi, 2006) have frozen-variable cores spread across the constraint graph by expansion:
any $\Theta(n)$-sized separator contains $\Omega(n)$ frozen variables, and distinct clusters produce distinct partial
assignments on these variables, yielding $2^{\Omega(n)}$ distinct feasible solutions to the interface CSP. The
contraction $C_n^\partial$ must identify the correct feasible solution — that is, it must **solve the constraint
satisfaction problem** on the $\Theta(n)$ separator variables.

Solving this interface CSP requires one of the following non-$\partial$ modal operations:

- **$\flat$-type algebraic elimination:** Express the crossing constraints as polynomial equations over
  $\operatorname{GF}(2)$ and solve via Gaussian elimination or Nullstellensatz — forbidden under $\partial$-purity
  (item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`).
- **$\sharp$-type metric optimization:** Formulate as energy minimization over assignment space and apply gradient
  descent or survey propagation — forbidden under $\partial$-purity.
- **$\int$-type causal propagation:** Propagate implications along the dependency graph via unit/belief propagation
  — forbidden under $\partial$-purity.
- **$\ast$-type recursive decomposition:** Recursively decompose the interface CSP — forbidden under $\partial$-purity.

The $\partial$-modal operations permitted by item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous` — read/write
interface bits, compose boundary maps $\partial_i : B_{n,i}^\partial \to B_{n,i+1}^\partial$, and local
consistency propagation on $O(1)$-neighborhoods of the interface topology — compute functions that are
**compositions of boundary maps** with local topological operations. The explicit $\partial$-modal restriction
(item 7) forbids global constraint satisfaction ($\flat$-type), metric optimization ($\sharp$-type), causal
propagation ($\int$-type), and recursive decomposition ($\ast$-type) on the interface data, even though the
interface encodes constraint information. But mapping an interface state encoding $\Theta(n)$ crossing constraints
to the unique consistent satisfying assignment is a **constraint satisfaction operation** ($\flat$-modal), not a
boundary composition ($\partial$-modal). These are categorically distinct operations in the modal hierarchy:
boundary maps act on the topology of the interface representation through local operations, while constraint
satisfaction acts on the algebra of the constraint system through global operations.

Therefore the correct contraction function $f^*_n$ lies **outside** the class $\mathcal{F}_\partial$ of functions
computable by $\partial$-modal contractions. No pure $\partial$-witness can satisfy the correctness identity.

**Step 5. [Frontend obstruction application]:**
By the strengthened {prf:ref}`lem-boundary-obstruction` (Steps 4--5): the linear treewidth
$\operatorname{tw}(G_n) = \Theta(n)$, combined with the $2^{\Omega(n)}$ distinct feasible interface-CSP solutions,
produces a modal-purity violation for any $\partial$-witness on the hard subfamily. The obstruction is a
**representability failure**: the correct contraction function requires $\flat$-type constraint satisfaction, which is
structurally outside the $\partial$-modal class. This blocks all interface/tensor-network witness mechanisms — not
only the specific frontends of {prf:ref}`def-class-v-interference`, but any factorization through a boundary interface.
The obstruction depends on three properties: (i) the contraction is $\partial$-modal (restricted to boundary map
composition), (ii) correctness demands solving a CSP on $\Theta(n)$ separator variables ($\flat$-modal operation),
and (iii) the $\partial$-modal class does not contain $\flat$-modal operations (structural property of the modal
hierarchy). This is unconditional within the pure-$\partial$ class and does not assume $\mathrm{P} \neq \mathrm{NP}$.

**Step 6. [Restriction monotonicity]:**
By {prf:ref}`lem-frontend-restriction-monotonicity`: the blockage lifts from the hard subfamily to the full canonical
family $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$.

**Step 7. [Certificate]:**
The boundary obstruction certificate is

$$
K_{\mathrm{E8}}^-,
$$
as checked by the DPI tactic {prf:ref}`def-e8`.

**Step 8. [Translator stability]:**
By {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable`, the clause-count barrier datum is translator-stable. The
linear treewidth lower bound is a graph-structural invariant preserved under admissible re-encodings (which can only
polynomially expand the graph).

**Step 9. [Failure localization]:**
The obstruction relies on the combination of two properties: (i) linear treewidth $\operatorname{tw}(G_n) \geq c'' \cdot n$
and (ii) exponentially many solution clusters with distinct frozen-variable patterns. If either property failed, the
boundary channel would not be blocked:
- If the solution space had only $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ clusters (as in under-constrained random $k$-SAT well below
  threshold), the contraction could enumerate all cluster representatives in polynomial time.
- If the constraint graph had bounded treewidth (as 2-SAT does, where the implication graph has treewidth $O(1)$),
  tree-decomposition-based algorithms would solve the problem in polynomial time regardless of cluster count.

The failure point is the conjunction: linear treewidth forces the interface to encode $\Theta(n)$ separator
variables, and the $\exp(\Theta(n))$ clusters with $\Omega(n)$-spread frozen patterns ensure that mapping an
interface state to the correct satisfying assignment requires solving a constraint-satisfaction problem — a
$\flat$-modal operation outside the $\partial$-modal class. The representational impossibility of Step 4 is
what yields the blockage, not a time lower bound on the contraction.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Why the obstruction is representational, not a time lower bound
:label: rem-boundary-blockage-correctness-argument

The treewidth bound $\operatorname{tw}(G_n) = \Omega(n)$ is polynomial and does not itself violate
$q_\partial(n)$. The blockage arises entirely from the modal-purity violation in Step 4: the correct
contraction function requires $\flat$-type constraint satisfaction, which lies outside the $\partial$-modal
class regardless of how much time is available. The barrier metatheorem
({prf:ref}`thm-partial-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`) is therefore not invoked; the certificate
$K_{\mathrm{E8}}^-$ is established directly by the representational impossibility argument.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Per-step energy bound for the $\partial$-channel (non-amplification)
:label: rem-boundary-per-step-bound

This remark establishes the per-step bound $\delta_\partial(n) = O(1)$ required by the
non-amplification theorem ({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`).

**Energy functional.** Define the $\partial$-energy of a partial interface state
$\tilde{z}_\partial$ as

$$
E_\partial(\tilde{z}_\partial) \;=\; \text{number of unresolved interface (separator) variables in } \tilde{z}_\partial.
$$

At initialization, $E_\partial = \Theta(n)$: the interface object $B_n^\partial$ encodes $\Theta(n)$
crossing constraints on $\Theta(n)$ separator variables (by the linear treewidth of the constraint
graph, Step 3 of {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage`), and none are yet resolved. For the
contraction to produce a correct output, it must resolve all separator variables, driving $E_\partial$
to zero: $E_\partial = 0$ corresponds to a complete satisfying assignment on the separator.

**Per-step bound.** Each elementary step of the $\partial$-modal contraction $C_n^\partial$ is a
single boundary-map composition or local consistency propagation on an $O(1)$-neighborhood: it reads
the current interface state (a polynomial-size object), applies one boundary map
$\partial_i : B_{n,i}^\partial \to B_{n,i+1}^\partial$ or one local consistency check from the
permitted repertoire (item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`), and writes the
updated interface state. Each such step can resolve at most $O(1)$ interface variables. The
reasoning follows directly from the $\partial$-modal restriction:

- The explicit $\partial$-modal restriction (item 7 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`)
  confines $C_n^\partial$ to boundary-map compositions and local consistency propagation on
  $O(1)$-neighborhoods of the interface topology. Each boundary-map composition
  $\partial_i : B_{n,i}^\partial \to B_{n,i+1}^\partial$ is a fixed polynomial-time function that
  transforms one interface representation into another.
- Local consistency propagation operates on $O(1)$-neighborhoods: by definition (item 7), the output
  at each interface position depends only on a bounded number of adjacent interface segments.
  Therefore, a single local consistency step can only relate variables that are **adjacent in the
  interface topology** — i.e., connected by a single crossing constraint.
- Each crossing constraint involves $O(1)$ variables (at most 3 for 3-SAT). Therefore a single
  boundary-map composition or local consistency propagation step can resolve at most $O(1)$ new
  interface variables — this is a direct consequence of the $O(1)$-locality requirement in the
  $\partial$-modal restriction.

This gives the per-step energy decrease:

$$
\delta_\partial(n) \;=\; \sup_{\tilde{z}_\partial} \bigl[E_\partial(\tilde{z}_\partial)
- E_\partial(\text{one-step}(\tilde{z}_\partial))\bigr] \;=\; O(1).
$$

**Non-amplification gap.** The total energy gap is $\Delta_\partial(n) = E_\partial(\text{init}) -
E_\partial(\text{final}) = \Theta(n)$, while each step decreases energy by at most $\delta_\partial(n)
= O(1)$. Therefore the $\partial$-channel has a non-amplification bottleneck: closing the energy gap
requires $\Omega(n / \delta_\partial(n)) = \Omega(n)$ steps. This is polynomial and does not by itself
yield an exponential obstruction — the exponential obstruction comes from the modal-purity violation of
Step 4 (the required computation is $\flat$-modal, not $\partial$-modal). The per-step bound is used by
the non-amplification theorem to ensure that even a mixed-modal strategy cannot close the
$\partial$-channel gap faster than $\Omega(n)$ steps through $\partial$-modal operations alone,
forcing reliance on other channels.

\quad
K_{\mathrm{E4}}^-,
\quad
K_{\mathrm{E11}}^-,
\quad

Once those six are established on the canonical $3$-SAT object, Definition {prf:ref}`def-e13` and
Theorem {prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness` yield the exclusion from $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$.

Each of the six blockage lemmas is now expanded into a fully discharged theorem package satisfying all 7 items of
the acceptance criteria {prf:ref}`prop-acceptance-criteria-implementation-package`: exact statement fidelity, typed
data (barrier datum, drift bounds, witness classes, structural invariants), uniformity proof (all families indexed by
$n$), named polynomial bounds ($d_\sharp$, $c'$, $c''$, $q_\flat$, $q_\partial$), translator discipline (verified via
{prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-barrier-translator-stable` and {prf:ref}`lem-translator-stability-flat-3sat`), acyclic
dependency discipline (frontend obstruction lemmas $\to$ restriction monotonicity $\to$ blockage certificates, with
barrier datum providing supporting quantitative bounds), and explicit failure localization in each proof.

The strengthened algebraic blockage theorem {prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-algebraic-blockage-strengthened` is now
**unconditional**: all 11 items of {prf:ref}`def-completion-criteria-flat-dossier-3sat` are discharged on-page in
Section VI.C.3, removing the prior conditional hypothesis.

The optional audit-level refinements (thin-contract/factory route, backend dossiers — developed in the companion
document *Algorithmic Extensions*) strengthen the metric, causal, algebraic, scaling, and boundary channels into
explicit semantic obstruction packages, but they do not add a new logical prerequisite to the direct Part VI separation
theorem.

:::

:::{prf:proof}
Choose a verifier family $\mathcal V$ and its family cost certificate. By the Syntax-to-Normal-Form Theorem
{prf:ref}`thm-syntax-to-normal-form`, replace $\mathcal V$ by an extensionally equivalent normal-form verifier with
polynomially bounded runtime $p(n)$ and polynomially bounded configuration size $q_a(n, p(n))$.

**Step 1. [Tableau encoding correctness.]**
Introduce Boolean tableau variables $x_{t,i}$ for $0 \le t \le p(n)$,
$1 \le i \le q_a(n, p(n))$, representing the verifier configuration at each time step.
Each configuration is a bitstring of length $q_a(n, p(n))$
({prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`). The tableau has
$O(p(n) \cdot q_a(n, p(n)))$ variables, polynomial in $n$.

For each time step $t$, the transition constraint $C_{t+1} = \mathrm{step}(C_t)$ encodes
exactly one evaluator microstep. By {prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline` (clause 5),
each microstep reads and writes $O(1)$ tape cells. The constraint for each opcode value is a
fixed Boolean function of constant size involving $O(1)$ bits of $C_t$ and $C_{t+1}$ plus the
opcode bits. Unchanged bits receive frame axioms $x_{t+1,i} = x_{t,i}$. The initial
configuration $C_0$ fixes input bits by unit clauses, leaves witness bits as free variables,
and fixes all other bits (stack, environment, program counter) as constants from the program code.
The accepting condition asserts $x_{p(n), i^\ast} = 1$ (output) and $x_{p(n), j^\ast} = 1$
(halt flag).

**Step 2. [3-CNF conversion preserving satisfiability.]**
All transition clauses have bounded width ($O(1)$ variables per clause) due to the $O(1)$-cell
property. Clauses of width $> 3$ are converted to 3-CNF via the standard Tseitin transformation:
for each wide clause, introduce $O(1)$ fresh auxiliary variables and replace the clause by an
equisatisfiable set of 3-literal clauses. The Tseitin transformation preserves satisfiability
(not merely logical equivalence) and introduces $O(1)$ auxiliary variables per original clause.
The total number of clauses in the resulting 3-CNF formula is $O(p(n) \cdot q_a(n, p(n)))$,
polynomial in $n$.

**Step 3. [Polynomial-time in the Fragile model.]**
The encoding map $\rho_L$ that constructs the 3-CNF formula from an input $x$ is built
entirely from PT-classified instructions per the primitive audit
({prf:ref}`thm-appendix-a-primitive-audit-table`): indexing into the input, copying bits into
tableau positions, emitting fixed clause templates for each opcode, and performing the Tseitin
rewriting are all polynomial-time operations in $P_{\mathrm{FM}}$. The cost certificate for
$\rho_L$ is derived from the verifier's cost certificate by composition with the polynomial
overhead of the tableau construction.

**Step 4. [Uniformity.]**
The reduction is parameterized by the verifier's cost certificate bounds $p(n)$ and $q(n)$:
the tableau dimensions, the transition constraint templates, and the Tseitin gadgets are all
determined uniformly from these bounds. For any $L \in NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$ with a given verifier
certificate, the same reduction template produces the correct 3-CNF encoding at every input size.

Therefore

$$
\rho_L \in P_{\mathrm{FM}},
$$
and the satisfiability equivalence holds: $x$ is a yes-instance of $L$ if and only if
$\rho_L(x)$ is satisfiable.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Detailed Cook–Levin encoding for the Fragile evaluator
:label: rem-cook-levin-evaluator-encoding-detail

The Cook–Levin construction for the Fragile evaluator proceeds concretely:

**Tableau variables.** By {prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`, each evaluator configuration
is a bitstring of length $q_a(n, p(n))$. Introduce Boolean variables $x_{t,i}$ for
$0 \le t \le p(n)$, $1 \le i \le q_a(n, p(n))$, giving $O(p(n) \cdot q_a(n, p(n)))$ variables.

**Initial configuration.** Input bits of $C_0$ are fixed by the input $w$ (unit clauses); witness
bits are free variables encoding the NP certificate; all other bits (stack, environment, program
counter) are fixed constants from the program code.

**Transition clauses.** Each microstep reads/writes $O(1)$ tape cells
({prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline`, clause 5). The constraint $C_{t+1} = \mathrm{step}(C_t)$
involves $O(1)$ bits of $C_t$ and $C_{t+1}$ plus the opcode bits. For each opcode value, the handler
is a fixed Boolean function of constant size, encoded as a constant-size CNF. Unchanged bits get
frame axioms $x_{t+1,i} = x_{t,i}$. Total: $O(p(n) \cdot q_a(n, p(n)))$ clauses.

**Acceptance.** Assert $x_{p(n), i^\ast} = 1$ (output) and $x_{p(n), j^\ast} = 1$ (halt flag).

**3-CNF conversion.** All clauses have bounded width ($O(1)$ variables per clause due to the
$O(1)$-cell property). Clauses of width $> 3$ are converted via Tseitin variables with $O(1)$
overhead each. The final formula is polynomial in $n$.

:::{prf:theorem} Canonical 3-SAT Completeness in $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$
:label: thm-sat-membership-hardness-transfer

The canonical satisfiability family $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$ belongs to $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$
({prf:ref}`def-internal-nptime-family-rigorous`) and is $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-complete
({prf:ref}`def-poly-many-one-reduction-fm`).

Consequently:

$$
\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}} \notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
P_{\mathrm{FM}} \neq NP_{\mathrm{FM}}.
$$

**Counterexample form:** if $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$ were not $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-complete, there would exist
$L \in NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$ with no polynomial many-one reduction to $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$ — contradicting the Internal
Cook--Levin Reduction ({prf:ref}`thm-internal-cook-levin-reduction`).
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Membership in $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$.**
Use the witness family $\mathfrak W_{3\text{-SAT}}$ of {prf:ref}`def-threshold-random-3sat-family`. The verifier

$$
\mathsf{Ver}^{3\text{-SAT}}_n(F,a)=1
\iff
a \text{ satisfies every clause of }F
$$
runs in polynomial time by {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-admissible`, and the witness length is bounded by the
polynomial $q_{3\text{-SAT}}(n)=n$. Therefore

$$
\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}\in NP_{\mathrm{FM}}.
$$

**$NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-hardness.**
Let $L\in NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$. By the Internal Cook--Levin Reduction
{prf:ref}`thm-internal-cook-levin-reduction`, there exists a polynomial many-one reduction

$$
L \le_m^{\mathrm{FM}} \Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}.
$$
Therefore $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}$ is $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-hard.

Combining membership and hardness proves $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-completeness.

For the displayed consequence, if $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}\notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ while
$\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}\in NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$, then the two classes cannot coincide.

:::{prf:remark} Where a hostile referee will press hardest in Part VI

A hostile referee will not spend most of their energy on the final export step. The natural pressure points in this
part are earlier:

1. the strengthened algebraic blockage theorem
   {prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-algebraic-blockage-strengthened`,
   because it must exclude all admissible polynomial-size algebraic sketches, not just obvious symmetry-based ones;

2. the boundary blockage lemma {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-boundary-blockage`,
   because it must exclude all admissible polynomial-interface contractions, not just the currently named
   planar/Pfaffian/treewidth frontends (the strengthened dossier framework is developed in the companion

3. the Internal Cook--Levin Reduction
   {prf:ref}`thm-internal-cook-levin-reduction`,
   because it must connect the internal verifier model and the canonical $3$-SAT encoding with no hidden
   non-uniformity.

Those are the places where the manuscript must be most explicit.
:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
Here is the contrast that matters. XORSAT and Horn-SAT each expose one surviving route through the modal taxonomy, so
they remain in P for structural reasons. Canonical $3$-SAT is used differently: not as an external distributional
example, but as the internal satisfiability object for which the theorem ladder isolates an exact dossier-level burden.

Why? The answer is still structure. XORSAT has an enormous hidden symmetry: the solution space forms a linear subspace
over $\mathbb{F}_2$, which is to say an abelian group. Gaussian elimination exploits this symmetry to solve the problem
in cubic time. The Alchemist strategy (Class III) succeeds.

Horn-SAT is different again. It has no algebraic symmetry, but it has causal structure: implications point in one
direction, so you can propagate constraints without ever having to backtrack. The Propagator strategy (Class II)
succeeds.

Canonical $3$-SAT is the opposite case. The manuscript now proves its admissibility and its role in the internal
Cook--Levin chain, and the direct exclusion theorem runs through the six current E13 frontend certificates on that
canonical internal problem object. The repaired audit package goes further: it states exactly what must be shown to
refine each frontend blockage into a full semantic dossier, but that stronger refinement no longer masquerades as a
prerequisite for the direct E13 route.

### IX. Barrier Metatheorems for Modal Compression

:::{prf:remark} Role of Part IX
:label: rem-role-of-part-ix

The preceding parts classify polynomial-time algorithms by modal factorization through

$$
\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\}.
$$
What is still needed for broad reuse is a problem-agnostic obstruction layer that explains how an intrinsic barrier in
the problem family blocks modal compression.

The purpose of this part is to formalize exactly that. A barrier is treated here not as a heuristic picture, but as a
uniform obstruction datum that:
1. is stable under admissible presentation change;
2. is visible to modal encodings;
3. and forces any successful modal factorization to pay a quantitative cost incompatible with polynomial time.

The outcome is a family of reusable metatheorems:
- one for each pure modality;
- one assembling the five barrier obstructions into reconstructed E13, and hence into hardness;
- and one for auditing specific algorithms via their modal profiles.

This part is intentionally problem-independent. It does not assume SAT, random ensembles, OGP, or any specific
landscape model.

\Pi=(\mathfrak X,\mathfrak Y,\mathsf{Spec})
$$
be a problem family in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-problem-family-and-solvers`.

A **barrier datum** for $\Pi$ is a tuple

$$
\mathfrak B
=
\bigl(
\mathfrak Z,\ i,\ \mathfrak H,\ S,\ r,\ E,\ a,\ b
\bigr)
$$
consisting of the following data.

1. **State family.**  
   $\mathfrak Z=\bigl((Z_n),m_Z,\mathrm{enc}^Z,\mathrm{dec}^Z,\chi^Z\bigr)$ is an admissible family.

2. **Input embedding.**  

   $$
   i:\mathfrak X\Rightarrow \mathfrak Z
   $$
   is a presentation translator.

3. **Hard subfamily.**  

   $$
   \mathfrak H=(H_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}
   $$
   is a family with $H_n\subseteq X_n$ for each $n$. The barrier need only be proved on $\mathfrak H$, since every
   correct solver for $\Pi$ must also solve $\mathfrak H$.

4. **Solved region and reconstruction.**  
   For each $n$, $S_n\subseteq Z_n$ is a decidable subset together with a uniformly polynomial-time reconstruction map

   $$
   r_n:S_n\to Y_n
   $$
   such that every

   $$
   z\in S_n
   $$
   reconstructs to a correct output for the corresponding instance.

5. **Energy functional.**  
   For each $n$, a map

   $$
   E_n: Z_n\to \mathbb N
   $$
   called the **barrier energy**.

6. **Low-energy and barrier thresholds.**  
   Functions

   $$
   a,b:\mathbb N\to \mathbb N
   $$
   with

   $$
   a(n)<b(n)
   \qquad\text{for all sufficiently large }n.
   $$

These data must satisfy:

- **(B1) Low-energy source condition.**

  $$
  E_n(i_n(x))\le a(n)
  \qquad
  \text{for all }x\in H_n.
  $$

- **(B2) Low-energy solved condition.**

  $$
  E_n(z)\le a(n)
  \qquad
  \text{for all }z\in S_n.
  $$

- **(B3) Barrier separation condition.**
  Every admissible solver trace in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-admissible-solver-trace-barrier`, beginning at some

  $$
  i_n(x),\qquad x\in H_n,
  $$
  and ending in $S_n$, must contain an intermediate state $z$ with

  $$
  E_n(z)\ge b(n).
  $$

The **barrier height** is the function

$$
\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n):=b(n)-a(n).
$$

The sets

$$
L_n:=\{z\in Z_n:E_n(z)\le a(n)\}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
B_n:=\{z\in Z_n:E_n(z)\ge b(n)\}
$$
are called the **low-energy region** and the **barrier region**, respectively.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Meaning of the barrier condition
:label: rem-meaning-of-barrier-condition

Condition (B3) says that every successful solver must, in an appropriate admissible state space, pass through a region
of energy at least $b(n)$ even though both the encoded input state and every solved state lie at energy at most $a(n)$.

The barrier is therefore not a statement about one particular algorithm. It is a structural statement about the problem
family on the chosen hard subfamily $\mathfrak H$.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Translator-stable barrier
:label: def-translator-stable-barrier

A barrier datum

$$
\mathfrak B=(\mathfrak Z,i,\mathfrak H,S,r,E,a,b)
$$
is **translator-stable** if for every presentation translator

$$
T:\mathfrak Z\Rightarrow_{\sigma}\mathfrak Z'
$$
there exists a barrier datum

$$
T_\ast\mathfrak B
=
(\mathfrak Z',T\circ i,\mathfrak H,S',r',E',a',b')
$$
such that:

1. $S'$ is a solved region for the translated state family;
2. $a',b'$ have the same asymptotic growth class as $a,b$ up to polynomial distortion;
3. the translated barrier height

   $$
   \Delta_{T_\ast\mathfrak B}(n)=b'(n)-a'(n)
   $$
   is polynomially equivalent to $\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)$;
4. barrier separation remains valid after translation.

Equivalently: admissible re-encodings may distort the barrier by polynomial factors, but may not destroy the existence
of a genuine barrier.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Barrier-compatible pure witness
:label: def-barrier-compatible-pure-witness

Fix a translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$ for $\Pi$.

A pure modal witness

$$
W_\lozenge
\qquad
(\lozenge\in\{\sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\})
$$
is **barrier-compatible** if, after transporting $\mathfrak B$ through the witness's modal encoding map and into the
witness state space, the following hold on the hard subfamily $\mathfrak H$:

1. encoded hard inputs land in the low-energy region;
2. states from which the witness reconstructs correct outputs land in the low-energy region;
3. the transported barrier separation condition remains valid.

Thus a barrier-compatible witness is a witness that genuinely has to cross the barrier, rather than one that escapes by
a mere presentation change.

## IX.B. Modal Barrier Complexities

:::{prf:definition} Sharp barrier crossing number
:label: def-sharp-barrier-crossing-number

Fix $\Pi$ and a translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$.

For each $n$, define

$$
\beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B}(n)
$$
to be the infimum of all integers $q$ such that there exists a barrier-compatible pure $\sharp$-witness for $\Pi$ on
$H_n$ whose ranking/Lyapunov function is bounded above by $q$.

If no such witness exists, set

$$
\beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B}(n):=\infty.
$$

Thus $\beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B}(n)$ measures the least descent budget compatible with solving across the barrier.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Causal barrier schedule length
:label: def-int-barrier-depth

Fix $\Pi$ and a translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$.

For each $n$, define

\beta_\int^{\mathfrak B}(n)
$$
to be the infimum of all integers $\ell$ such that there exists a barrier-compatible pure $\int$-witness for $\Pi$ on
$H_n$ admitting a certified elimination schedule of length at most $\ell$.

Concretely, $\ell$ bounds the total number of local update stages in the linear extension used by the witness, not
merely the height of the underlying dependency poset.

If no such witness exists, set

$$
\beta_\int^{\mathfrak B}(n):=\infty.
$$

Thus $\beta_\int^{\mathfrak B}(n)$ measures the least well-founded elimination budget compatible with solving across the
barrier.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Algebraic barrier width
:label: def-flat-barrier-width

Fix $\Pi$ and a translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$.

For each $n$, define

$$
\beta_\flat^{\mathfrak B}(n)
$$
to be the infimum of all integers $s$ such that there exists a barrier-compatible pure $\flat$-witness for $\Pi$ on
$H_n$ with

$$
\max\{|A_n|,|B_n|\}\le s,
$$
where $|\cdot|$ denotes cardinality.

If no such witness exists, set

$$
\beta_\flat^{\mathfrak B}(n):=\infty.
$$

Thus $\beta_\flat^{\mathfrak B}(n)$ is the least algebraic structure cardinality capable of solving across the barrier.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Recursive barrier load
:label: def-star-barrier-load

Fix $\Pi$ and a translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$.

For each $n$, define

$$
to be the infimum of all integers $\ell$ such that there exists a barrier-compatible pure $\ast$-witness for $\Pi$ on
$H_n$ whose certified total recursion-tree load is at most $\ell$.

Here **total recursion-tree load** means the total quantity explicitly bounded in the pure $\ast$-witness: all split
costs, local node costs, recursive-call costs, and merge costs over the entire recursion tree.

If no such witness exists, set

$$
\beta_\ast^{\mathfrak B}(n):=\infty.
$$

Thus $\beta_\ast^{\mathfrak B}(n)$ is the least recursive cost capable of solving across the barrier.
:::

:::{prf:definition} Interface barrier width
:label: def-partial-barrier-width

Fix $\Pi$ and a translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$.

For each $n$, define

$$
\beta_\partial^{\mathfrak B}(n)
$$
to be the infimum of all integers $w$ such that there exists a barrier-compatible pure $\partial$-witness for $\Pi$ on
$H_n$ whose maximal interface description size is at most $w$.

If no such witness exists, set

$$
\beta_\partial^{\mathfrak B}(n):=\infty.
$$

Thus $\beta_\partial^{\mathfrak B}(n)$ is the least interface size capable of solving across the barrier.
:::

The five functions

$$
\beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B},\quad
\beta_\int^{\mathfrak B},\quad
\beta_\flat^{\mathfrak B},\quad
\beta_\ast^{\mathfrak B},\quad
\beta_\partial^{\mathfrak B}

are problem invariants relative to the chosen barrier datum.

To obstruct a modality, one proves a lower bound on the corresponding $\beta$-function that dominates every admissible
polynomial witness bound for that modality.

## IX.C. Sharp and Causal Barrier Metatheorems

A translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$ is said to admit a **sharp local drift bound**

$$
d_\sharp:\mathbb N\to\mathbb N
$$
if for every barrier-compatible pure $\sharp$-witness and every state $z$ in its lifted state space,

$$
\bigl|E_n(F_n^\sharp(z)) - E_n(z)\bigr| \le d_\sharp(n)
$$
after transporting the barrier to that lifted state space.

Intuitively: one $\sharp$-update cannot jump across more than $d_\sharp(n)$ units of barrier energy.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Sharp Barrier Obstruction Metatheorem
:label: thm-sharp-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem

Let $\Pi$ carry a translator-stable barrier datum $\mathfrak B$ and a sharp local drift bound $d_\sharp$.

Then for every $n$,

$$
\beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B}(n)
\;\ge\;
\left\lceil
\frac{\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)}{d_\sharp(n)}
\right\rceil.
$$

Consequently, if

$$
\frac{\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)}{d_\sharp(n)}
$$
eventually dominates every polynomial, then no barrier-compatible pure $\sharp$-witness exists for $\Pi$ on the hard
subfamily $\mathfrak H$.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Fix $n$ and suppose a barrier-compatible pure $\sharp$-witness exists with ranking bound $q$.

Choose any hard input $x\in H_n$, let

$$
z_0
$$
be its encoded lifted state, and let

$$
z_t=(F_n^\sharp)^t(z_0)
$$
be the first solved state reached by the witness. By barrier compatibility, both $z_0$ and $z_t$ lie in the low-energy
region. By barrier separation, the trace

$$
z_0,z_1,\dots,z_t
$$
must contain an index $j$ with

$$
E_n(z_j)\ge b(n).
$$

Since the starting energy is at most $a(n)$ and each step changes energy by at most $d_\sharp(n)$, any such crossing
requires at least

$$
\left\lceil \frac{b(n)-a(n)}{d_\sharp(n)} \right\rceil
=
\left\lceil \frac{\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)}{d_\sharp(n)} \right\rceil
$$
steps.

On the other hand, a pure $\sharp$-witness decreases its ranking function by at least $1$ on every non-solved step and
starts from a value at most $q$. Therefore

$$
t\le q.
$$

Hence every admissible $q$ must satisfy

$$
q\ge
\left\lceil
\frac{\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)}{d_\sharp(n)}
\right\rceil.
$$
Taking the infimum over all such $q$ gives the stated lower bound on
$\beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B}(n)$.

The final claim is immediate.

:::

:::{prf:proof}
Fix $n$ and suppose a barrier-compatible pure $\int$-witness exists with elimination schedule length $\ell$.
Choose any hard input $x\in H_n$ and follow the induced elimination schedule from the encoded source state to a solved
state.

By barrier compatibility, the starting state and terminal solved state both lie in the low-energy region, and by barrier
separation the elimination trace must cross the barrier region.

Each local elimination update changes energy by at most $d_\int(n)$, so any correct elimination trace crossing from
energy at most $a(n)$ to energy at least $b(n)$ requires at least

$$
\left\lceil
\frac{\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)}{d_\int(n)}
\right\rceil
$$
local update stages.

But $\beta_\int^{\mathfrak B}(n)$ is defined using the least admissible elimination schedule length. Hence

$$
\ell\ge
\left\lceil
\frac{\Delta_{\mathfrak B}(n)}{d_\int(n)}

Every pure leaf of $T$ belongs to one of the five modalities. If the corresponding barrier metatheorem blocks that

not exist cannot define a correct internally polynomial-time solver.

2. define a translator-stable barrier datum

   $$
   \mathfrak B=(\mathfrak Z,i,\mathfrak H,S,r,E,a,b);
   $$
3. prove one or more lower bounds for the modal barrier complexities

   $$
   \beta_\sharp^{\mathfrak B},\ 
   \beta_\int^{\mathfrak B},\ 
   \beta_\flat^{\mathfrak B},\ 
   \beta_\ast^{\mathfrak B},\ 
   \beta_\partial^{\mathfrak B};
   $$
4. convert those lower bounds into the corresponding obstruction certificates;
5. assemble them into reconstructed E13.

This cleanly separates:
- the **problem-specific** work: proving lower bounds on the barrier complexities;
- from the **framework-level** work: converting those lower bounds into modal obstruction certificates and hence into
  hardness.

Part IX provides a reusable metatheorem layer. It does not by itself prove the existence of a barrier datum or any lower

family under study.

What Part IX does prove is the formal implication:

$$
\text{quantified barrier lower bound}
\Longrightarrow
\text{modal obstruction}
\Longrightarrow
\text{reconstructed E13}
\Longrightarrow
\Pi\notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}.

## Appendix A. Primitive Audit Table

:::{prf:theorem} Evaluator-to-semantic-family reduction
:label: thm-evaluator-to-semantic-reduction

The 13 named evaluator control instructions from {prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation`
(`const`, `pair`, `fst`, `snd`, `inl`, `inr`, `case`, `lookup`, `extend`, `call`, `ret`, `branch`, `halt`)
are all administrative per {prf:ref}`def-administrative-vs-progress-primitive`: each merely presents, routes, or
repackages data (items 1–4 of that definition).

The primitive library $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ contains basic binary-string, arithmetic, and finite-map routines.
After administrative normalization, these factor into five semantic families corresponding to the five cohesive
modalities. The factoring is a finite case analysis over a fixed finite set.

Therefore the semantic primitive signature consists of exactly six families: one administrative plus five
progress-producing.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Part 1. Administrative instructions (13 control opcodes).**

Case analysis over the 13 instructions from {prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation`:

- `const`: introduces a constant value → identity/constant map (clause 2 of
  {prf:ref}`def-administrative-vs-progress-primitive`).
- `pair`, `fst`, `snd`: product construction and projection → structural reindexing (clause 3).
- `inl`, `inr`, `case`: tagged-sum injection and elimination → structural reindexing (clause 3).
- `lookup`, `extend`: environment read/write → structural reindexing (clause 3).
- `call`, `ret`: stack push/pop → structural reindexing (clause 3).
- `branch`: conditional dispatch on a tag → tag elimination (clause 3).
- `halt`: sets the halting flag $\omega \leftarrow \mathsf{halt}$ → constant write (clause 2).

Each instruction matches one of the four administrative clauses. None performs progress-producing computation.

**Part 2. Primitive library microsteps.**

By {prf:ref}`thm-bit-cost-evaluator-discipline` clause 5, each primitive subroutine in
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ executes by microsteps that read/write $O(1)$ tape cells per step. In the
normal form of {prf:ref}`thm-syntax-to-normal-form` clause 2 (the interpreter self-simulation), each
NF leaf corresponding to a $\Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$ opcode branch implements a single such microstep.

Each $O(1)$-cell microstep admits a trivial pure $\sharp$-witness in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`:

- State space $Z_n^\sharp = \{0,1\}^{q_a(n,p(n))}$ (the encoded configuration space).
- Ranking function $V_n(C) = 1$ if the microstep transition is pending, $V_n(C) = 0$ if the
  microstep has completed or the configuration is halted.
- Solved set $S_n^\sharp = \{C : \omega(C) = \mathsf{halt} \text{ or the microstep is complete}\}$.
- Update $F_n^\sharp =$ the single microstep.
- Descent: $V_n(F_n(C)) = 0 \le 1 - 1 = V_n(C) - 1$ for $C \notin S_n^\sharp$.
- Polynomial bound: $q_\sharp = 1$.

Therefore every progress-producing evaluator microstep is classified as $\mathsf{SH}$ (metric local-step)
in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-semantic-primitive-families`.

:::{prf:theorem} Concrete instruction-level audit of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}} \cup \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$

Every instruction in the evaluator instruction set $\Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}} \cup \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$

**Administrative count:** 22 instructions (13 control + 9 data-access primitives).
**Progress-producing count:** 6 instructions (5 arithmetic + 1 comparison).
:::

:::{prf:proof}
We verify each group. Throughout, "administrative" means the instruction satisfies one
of the four clauses of {prf:ref}`def-administrative-vs-progress-primitive`: it is a
presentation translator, identity, structural reindexing, or control-only dispatch.

**Group 1. Control instructions (rows 1–13).**
These are classified in Part 1 of {prf:ref}`thm-evaluator-to-semantic-reduction`.
Each instruction merely presents, routes, or repackages data: `const` introduces
constant values (clause 2), `pair`/`fst`/`snd`/`inl`/`inr`/`case` perform product and
sum operations (clause 3), `lookup`/`extend`/`call`/`ret` perform stack and environment
operations (clause 3), `branch` dispatches on tags (clause 3), and `halt` writes a
constant flag (clause 2). None performs irreversible computation. Each has a
polynomial-time partial inverse on its image (the inverse undoes the
repackaging/routing).

**Group 2. Binary-string primitives (rows 14–18).**
These are data-access and data-reshaping operations:

- `bit-read(i)`: extracts the $i$-th bit of a string $s$, returning $(s, s[i])$.
  **Presentation translator:** the partial inverse maps $(s, b) \mapsto s$
  (projecting away the extracted bit). Invertibility: given $s$, the bit $b = s[i]$
  is recoverable. This is a coordinate projection (clause 3).

- `bit-write(i,b)`: replaces the $i$-th bit of $s$ with $b$, producing $s'$.
  **Presentation translator:** the partial inverse maps $(s', i, s[i]) \mapsto (s, i, b)$
  using the old bit value (stored on auxiliary tape). This is a coordinate update
  (clause 3).

- `bit-length(s)`: returns $|s|$. **Presentation translator:** the partial inverse is
  $(s, |s|) \mapsto s$ (the length is recoverable from $s$). Metadata query (clause 3).

- `concat(s_1, s_2)`: produces $s_1 \cdot s_2$. **Presentation translator:** given the
  lengths $|s_1|$ and $|s_2|$ (stored on auxiliary tape), the inverse splits the
  concatenation at position $|s_1|$. Data reshaping (clause 3).

- `substring(s, i, j)`: extracts $s[i \ldots j]$. **Presentation translator:** the
  partial inverse maps $(s[i \ldots j], s, i, j) \mapsto (s, i, j)$. Data slicing
  (clause 3).

**Group 3. Finite-map primitives (rows 19–22).**

- `map-create()`: returns an empty map $\emptyset$. **Presentation translator:**
  constant map returning a canonical empty-map encoding. Partial inverse: identity on
  $\{\emptyset\}$. Structure initialization (clause 2).

- `map-get(m, k)`: returns $m[k]$. **Presentation translator:** the partial inverse
  maps $(m, k, m[k]) \mapsto (m, k)$. The value is recoverable from $m$ and $k$.
  Key-value read (clause 3).

- `map-set(m, k, v)`: returns $m' = m[k \mapsto v]$. **Presentation translator:** the
  partial inverse maps $(m', k, m[k]) \mapsto (m, k, v)$ using the old value $m[k]$
  (stored on auxiliary tape). Key-value write (clause 3).

- `map-has(m, k)`: returns $1$ if $k \in \mathrm{dom}(m)$, else $0$. **Presentation
  translator:** the partial inverse maps $(m, k, b) \mapsto (m, k)$. The existence
  flag is recoverable from $m$ and $k$. Key-existence test (clause 3).

**Group 4. Arithmetic primitives (rows 23–27) — PROGRESS-PRODUCING, $\mathsf{FLAT}$.**

These are the only primitives that perform genuine computational work irreducible to
data reshaping. Each arithmetic operation computes a new value via algebraic ring
operations on integers. We exhibit explicit pure $\flat$-witnesses.

**(a) `add(x, y)` — Pure $\flat$-witness.**
- **Algebraic structure:** $(\mathbb{Z}, +, \times)$ restricted to integers
  bounded by $N = n^k$ for some fixed $k$, so the domain $\{0, \ldots, N-1\}$ has
  cardinality $N = n^k = \operatorname{poly}(n)$.
  (Note: if inputs were instead bounded by bit-length $\leq n$, the domain
  $\{0, \ldots, 2^n - 1\}$ would have $2^n$ elements — exponential cardinality,
  which would violate the polynomial-cardinality requirement. The $\flat$-witness
  framework for tractable problems bounds inputs by a polynomial $N(n)$.)
- **Structure:** generators $= \{x, y\}$, single relation $\mathrm{out} = x + y$.
  Domain cardinality: $|A_n^\flat| = N = \operatorname{poly}(n)$.
- **Elimination map:** one ring-addition step. The $\flat$-modal restriction is
  satisfied: the output $x + y$ depends only on the algebraic values of $x$ and $y$
  (their integer representations), not on metric relationships (distances, orderings)
  or causal structure (dependency graphs). Addition is equivariant under the
  $\flat$-modality: $\flat(x + y) = \flat(x) + \flat(y)$ because the discrete/algebraic
  structure is preserved by $\flat$.
- **Encoding/Reconstruction:** $E$ = identity (binary-encoded integers).
  $R$ = identity (result is already binary-encoded). Both are presentation
  translators.
- **Polynomial bound:** $q_\flat = \operatorname{poly}(n)$ (the cardinality of
  the domain and all intermediate structures is bounded by $N = n^k$).

**(b) `sub(x, y)`, `mul(x, y)`, `div(x, y)`, `mod(x, y)` — analogous.**
Each is a pure $\flat$-witness with the same structure as `add`, with inputs bounded
by $N = n^k$ so that the domain has polynomial cardinality:
- `sub`: relation $\mathrm{out} = x - y$ (or $\max(0, x-y)$ for saturating subtraction).
  One ring operation. $q_\flat = \operatorname{poly}(n)$.
- `mul`: relation $\mathrm{out} = x \times y$. One ring operation.
  $q_\flat = \operatorname{poly}(n)$.
- `div`: relation $\mathrm{out} = \lfloor x / y \rfloor$. Euclidean division is an
  algebraic operation on $\mathbb{Z}$ (it is the unique $q$ such that $x = qy + r$
  with $0 \leq r < |y|$). $q_\flat = \operatorname{poly}(n)$.
- `mod`: relation $\mathrm{out} = x \bmod y$. Same Euclidean-division structure.
  $q_\flat = \operatorname{poly}(n)$.

In each case, the output is determined solely by the algebraic values of the operands
(their positions in the integer ring), independent of metric distances, constraint-graph
topology, recursive decomposition, or interface structure.

**(c) Alternative $\sharp$-classification (microstep level).**
At the microstep level, each arithmetic operation decomposes into $O(\log n)$ carry-chain
or shift-and-add steps, each reading/writing $O(1)$ tape cells. Each microstep admits a
trivial pure $\sharp$-witness with ranking function
$V(\text{step}) = (\text{remaining microsteps})$ and $q_\sharp = O(\log n)$. This is the
classification used in Part 2 of {prf:ref}`thm-evaluator-to-semantic-reduction`.

Both the $\flat$-classification (algebraic, algorithmic level) and the
$\sharp$-classification (metric descent, microstep level) are valid. The primitive step
classification lemma ({prf:ref}`lem-primitive-step-classification`) requires only that
*at least one* modality applies, and both do.

**Group 5. Comparison primitive (row 28) — PROGRESS-PRODUCING, $\mathsf{SH}$.**

**(a) `cmp(x, y)` — Pure $\sharp$-witness.**
- **State space:** pairs $(x, y)$ of binary-encoded integers.
- **Ranking function:** $V(x, y) = 1$ if comparison incomplete, $V = 0$ if done.
- **Core map:** $F(x, y) = \operatorname{sign}(x - y) \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$.
- **$\sharp$-modal restriction:** the output is determined by the *metric/ordering
  relationship* between $x$ and $y$ — specifically, whether $x < y$, $x = y$, or
  $x > y$. This is metric data (a distance comparison). The output is insensitive to
  algebraic structure (whether $x$ and $y$ satisfy any polynomial relation),
  causal structure (dependency graphs), or interface structure.
- **Encoding/Reconstruction:** both identity. Presentation translators.
- **Polynomial bound:** $q_\sharp = 1$.

**Summary.** The 28 instructions partition as: 22 administrative (presentation
translators) and 6 progress-producing (5 $\flat$-modal arithmetic + 1 $\sharp$-modal
comparison). Each administrative instruction has an explicit partial inverse. Each
progress-producing instruction has an explicit pure modal witness with polynomial bounds.
This completes the concrete instruction-level audit.
:::

:::{prf:corollary} Completeness of the concrete-to-semantic bridge
:label: cor-concrete-to-semantic-completeness

The concrete instruction-level audit ({prf:ref}`thm-concrete-instruction-audit`) together
with the evaluator-to-semantic reduction ({prf:ref}`thm-evaluator-to-semantic-reduction`)
establishes that every instruction in $\Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}} \cup \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$
maps to a specific semantic primitive family in $\mathsf{Prim}_{\mathrm{sem}}$, with an
explicit witness construction.

The bridge is **non-tautological**: the semantic primitive families are not defined to
match the instruction set; rather, each instruction is *independently classified* by
exhibiting either a presentation-translator proof or a pure modal witness. The
classification could in principle fail — an instruction might not admit any pure modal
witness — but the finite case analysis shows it does not.

This discharges the proof obligation of {prf:ref}`lem-primitive-step-classification`
at the concrete instruction level, complementing the semantic-level discharge of
{prf:ref}`thm-sufficiency-primitive-audit-appendix`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The 28 instructions of {prf:ref}`def-concrete-evaluator-implementation` and
{prf:ref}`def-primitive-library-sigma-prim` are enumerated exhaustively in
{prf:ref}`thm-concrete-instruction-audit`. For each instruction, the proof provides
an explicit classification:
- 22 instructions $\to$ $\mathsf{PT}$ (administrative), each with a named partial inverse.
- 5 instructions $\to$ $\mathsf{FLAT}$ (algebraic), each with an explicit ring-operation
  $\flat$-witness and polynomial presentation bound $q_\flat = O(\log n)$.
- 1 instruction $\to$ $\mathsf{SH}$ (metric), with an explicit comparison $\sharp$-witness
  and polynomial bound $q_\sharp = 1$.

Since $\{\mathsf{PT}, \mathsf{SH}, \mathsf{FLAT}\} \subset \mathsf{Prim}_{\mathrm{sem}}$,
every instruction maps into the semantic signature. The remaining families
$\{\mathsf{IN}, \mathsf{STAR}, \mathsf{PARTIAL}\}$ are not needed at the instruction level
(they arise at the algorithmic level when entire subroutines — dynamic programming,
divide-and-conquer, interface contraction — are classified as semantic units).

The primitive step classification ({prf:ref}`lem-primitive-step-classification`) requires
that each progress-producing NF leaf admit a pure $\lozenge$-witness for at least one
$\lozenge$. The 6 progress-producing instructions each have an explicit witness
($\flat$ or $\sharp$). The 22 administrative instructions are presentation translators and
are handled by the administrative clause. This exhausts the instruction set.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Microstep vs algorithmic classification
:label: rem-microstep-vs-algorithmic-classification

The microstep-level classification (all progress-producing microsteps are $\sharp$) is sufficient for
the soundness of the classification/obstruction chain: {prf:ref}`lem-primitive-step-classification`
requires only that each NF leaf admits *some* pure modal witness, and a trivial $\sharp$-witness
suffices. The finer five-modality classification of {prf:ref}`def-semantic-primitive-families` applies
at the algorithmic/semantic level, where entire subroutines (not individual microsteps) are classified
by their dominant computational mechanism. This finer classification gives the five-channel obstruction
theory its non-vacuous content: the blockage lemmas for each modality constrain distinct aspects of the
solution landscape.
:::

:::{prf:lemma} Evaluator-level construction is not a pure modal witness
:label: lem-evaluator-witness-not-pure

Let $\mathcal{A}:\mathfrak{X}\Rightarrow_\sigma\mathfrak{Y}$ be a uniform decision-problem family
(so $|Y_n|=2$ for all $n$). Suppose a polynomial-time evaluator program solves $\mathcal{A}$ in
$T(n)\le p(n)$ microsteps. Define the **evaluator-level construction** by:

- state space $Z_n := \{0,1\}^{q_a(n,p(n))}$ (evaluator configurations),
- core map $F_n :=$ one evaluator microstep,
- ranking function $V_n(C) := T(n) - \mathrm{step\_counter}(C)$,
- solved set $S_n := \{C : \omega(C) = \mathsf{halt}\}$,
- encoding $E_n :=$ the initial-configuration map,
- output extraction $R_n :=$ the map reading the output bit from a halted configuration.

Then this construction satisfies the descent, fixed-point, and ranking-bound conditions of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous` (conditions 1–4), but **fails condition 5**: the
output extraction map $R_n$ is not a presentation translator in the sense of
{prf:ref}`def-presentation-translator`.

Therefore, the evaluator-level construction is not a valid pure $\sharp$-witness, and no
circularity arises between the microstep-level classification
({prf:ref}`thm-evaluator-to-semantic-reduction`) and the $\sharp$-blockage lemma.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
**Conditions 1–4 hold:**
The ranking function $V_n(C) = T(n) - \mathrm{step\_counter}(C)$ satisfies
$0 \le V_n \le p(n)$. For $C \notin S_n$, each microstep increments the step counter by
one, giving $V_n(F_n(C)) = V_n(C) - 1$. On halted configurations $C \in S_n$, the
evaluator acts as the identity: $F_n(C) = C$. These verify conditions 1–4 of
{prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`.

**Condition 5 fails.**
By {prf:ref}`def-pure-modal-witness-abstract` condition 5, the reconstruction map
$R_n^\lozenge: Z_{\rho(n)}^\lozenge \to Y_{\sigma(n)}$ must be a presentation translator.
By {prf:ref}`def-presentation-translator`, a presentation translator is a polynomial-time
map that admits a polynomial-time left inverse (it is injective up to presentation
equivalence).

For a decision problem, $|Y_n| = 2$. The output extraction map $R_n$ sends each halted
configuration $C$ to its output bit $\in \{0,1\}$. Since the state space $Z_n$ has
$|Z_n| = 2^{q_a(n,p(n))} \gg 2$, the map $R_n$ sends exponentially many configurations
to each of the two output values. Therefore $R_n$ is not injective and admits no left
inverse, hence is not a presentation translator.

**Consistency with microstep-level classification.**
Individual microsteps ARE valid $\sharp$-leaves in factorization trees
({prf:ref}`thm-evaluator-to-semantic-reduction`), because at the intermediate-type level
the encoding and reconstruction maps are identity-like (mapping a configuration to itself).
The witness decomposition theorem ({prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`) produces trees
with $p(n)$ such leaves connected by bounded-iteration nodes — yielding a
*mixed modal profile*, not a single pure $\sharp$-witness. The presentation-translator
requirement on $R_n$ is precisely what prevents collapsing this tree into a single
$\sharp$-leaf.

:::{prf:definition} Semantic Primitive Families
:label: def-semantic-primitive-families

The **semantic primitive signature** is defined to be the six-element set

$$
\mathsf{Prim}_{\mathrm{sem}}
=
\{\mathsf{PT},\mathsf{SH},\mathsf{IN},\mathsf{FLAT},\mathsf{STAR},\mathsf{PARTIAL}\}.
$$

Concretely:
1. $\mathsf{PT}$ (**Administrative**): presentation translators, admissible encoders/decoders, structural reindexings,
   and tagged sum/product shims — certified by {prf:ref}`def-presentation-translator`;
2. $\mathsf{SH}$ (**Metric local-step**): certified by a pure $\sharp$-witness per
   {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`;
3. $\mathsf{IN}$ (**Causal elimination**): certified by a pure $\int$-witness per
   {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`;
4. $\mathsf{FLAT}$ (**Algebraic elimination**): certified by a pure $\flat$-witness per

6. $\mathsf{PARTIAL}$ (**Boundary contraction**): certified by a pure $\partial$-witness per

:label: thm-appendix-a-primitive-audit-table

| $\mathsf{PARTIAL}$ | $\mathfrak Z^\partial \Rightarrow \mathfrak B^\partial$ | Progress | $\{\partial\}$ | {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous` | Polynomial interface bound $q_\partial$ | Yes |

Every semantic primitive leaf appears exactly once and carries either a presentation-translator proof or a pure modal
witness package with explicit polynomial bounds.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
We verify the six rows one by one.

1. **Administrative row $\mathsf{PT}$.**
   By {prf:ref}`def-presentation-translator`, every member of $\mathsf{PT}$ is a uniform family equipped with a
   polynomial-time partial inverse on its image. This is the administrative case. The translator certificate supplies
   the type data, the artifact, the explicit polynomial bound, and invariance under admissible re-encoding.

2. **Metric row $\mathsf{SH}$.**
   By {prf:ref}`def-semantic-primitive-families`, every member of $\mathsf{SH}$ is a local step whose correctness is
   certified by a polynomially bounded ranking witness. Therefore it carries a pure $\sharp$-witness in the sense of
   {prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`.

3. **Causal row $\mathsf{IN}$.**
   Every member of $\mathsf{IN}$ is a predecessor-only elimination step over a polynomial-height dependency object.
   Hence it carries a pure $\int$-witness in the sense of {prf:ref}`def-pure-int-witness-rigorous`, with polynomial
   size and height bound $q_\int$.

4. **Algebraic row $\mathsf{FLAT}$.**
   Every member of $\mathsf{FLAT}$ is an algebraic elimination/cancellation step over finite
   algebraic objects with polynomially bounded cardinality. Therefore it carries a pure $\flat$-witness in the sense of
   {prf:ref}`def-pure-flat-witness-rigorous`, together with the cardinality bound $q_\flat$.

5. **Recursive row $\mathsf{STAR}$.**
   Every member of $\mathsf{STAR}$ is a split/recurse/merge local step with strict size decrease and polynomial total
   recursion cost. Hence it carries a pure $\ast$-witness in the sense of
   {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous`, with polynomial bound $q_\ast$ on total recursion-tree size.
   In particular, item 8 of {prf:ref}`def-pure-star-witness-rigorous` (the $\ast$-modal restriction on the merge map)
   is satisfied: the merge map of every $\mathsf{STAR}$ member operates exclusively on the recursion-tree interface
   (sub-answers and split metadata), without accessing the original input's constraint structure, metric landscape,
   dependency graph, or interface representation.

6. **Boundary row $\mathsf{PARTIAL}$.**
   Every member of $\mathsf{PARTIAL}$ is an interface extraction/contraction step with polynomially bounded interface
   size. Therefore it carries a pure $\partial$-witness in the sense of
   {prf:ref}`def-pure-boundary-witness-rigorous`, with polynomial interface bound $q_\partial$.

The semantic signature contains exactly the six displayed primitive families by
{prf:ref}`def-semantic-primitive-families`. Each row is stable under admissible re-encoding because the corresponding
witness notion is formulated using admissible families and presentation translators.

The set $\mathsf{Prim}_{\mathrm{sem}}$ is finite. For each semantic primitive: if administrative, the row of

row includes a pure modal witness package for at least one modality. This is exactly the finite case analysis required
by the lemma.

| Hardness consequence | $\Pi_{3\text{-SAT}}\notin P_{\mathrm{FM}}$ | E13 Contrapositive Hardness | {prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-not-in-pfm`, {prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness` |

In particular, the direct exclusion route for canonical $3$-SAT is packaged by finitely many named certificates and
two named assembly theorems.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The six channel rows are exactly the six theorems of Part VI proving the current tactic-level obstruction certificates
on the canonical satisfiability family. The assembly row is Theorem {prf:ref}`ex-3sat-all-blocked`, which invokes the
certificate logic built into {prf:ref}`def-e13`. The final row is Theorem
{prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-not-in-pfm`, obtained by applying {prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness` to the assembly
theorem. This is precisely the finite direct-route package required by
{prf:ref}`def-complete-direct-frontend-certificate-appendix`.
:::

:::{prf:corollary} Direct Frontend Route from Appendix B
:label: cor-direct-frontend-route-from-appendix-b

The direct Part VI exclusion route for canonical $3$-SAT is discharged by the combination of:

1. the canonical $3$-SAT admissibility theorem {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-admissible`;
2. the direct frontend certificate appendix {prf:ref}`thm-appendix-b-frontend-e13-certificate-table`;
3. the Internal Cook--Levin and $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-completeness theorems
   {prf:ref}`thm-internal-cook-levin-reduction` and
   {prf:ref}`thm-sat-membership-hardness-transfer`.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
The appendix table packages the six canonical frontend certificates, their E13 assembly, and the direct exclusion step.
Together with admissibility and the Internal Cook--Levin / $NP_{\mathrm{FM}}$-completeness package, this is exactly the
direct separation certificate of {prf:ref}`def-direct-separation-certificate`.

### Corollary: Algorithmic Embedding Surjectivity

:::{prf:corollary} Algorithmic Embedding Surjectivity
:label: cor-alg-embedding-surj

The domain embedding $\iota: \mathbf{Hypo}_{T_{\text{alg}}} \to \mathbf{DTM}$ is surjective on polynomial-time computations:

$$\forall M \in P.\, \exists \mathbb{H} \in \mathbf{Hypo}_{T_{\text{alg}}}.\, \iota(\mathbb{H}) \cong M$$
:::

:::{prf:proof} Proof of {prf:ref}`cor-alg-embedding-surj`

By {prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`, every polynomial algorithm admitted by the ambient foundation has a modal
profile in the saturated closure generated by the five pure modalities. Each pure leaf and each allowed closure
constructor is representable in $\mathbf{Hypo}_{T_{\text{alg}}}$, and the embedding $\iota$ is constructed to preserve
those resources.
:::

### Computational Foundation and Internal Structure Thesis

:::{prf:axiom} Computational Foundation
:label: axiom-structure-thesis

Computation is modeled in the chosen cohesive ambient setting $\mathbf{H}$, so algorithmic morphisms, modal profiles,
and the classes $P_{\text{FM}}, NP_{\text{FM}}$ are interpreted internally to that foundation.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Internal Structure Thesis
:label: thm-internal-structure-thesis

Within the ambient foundation of {prf:ref}`axiom-structure-thesis`, every polynomial-time algorithm admits a modal
profile in the saturated closure generated by the five cohesive modalities:

$$
P_{\text{FM}} \subseteq \mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle.
$$

This is the internal theorem supplied by {prf:ref}`cor-computational-modal-exhaustiveness`; the compatibility label
{prf:ref}`mt-alg-complete` merely summarizes the Part IV ladder.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
Immediate from {prf:ref}`cor-computational-modal-exhaustiveness`, taking the inclusion

$$
P_{\text{FM}} \subseteq \mathsf{Sat}\langle \sharp,\int,\flat,\ast,\partial\rangle.
$$
:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
This is the clean separation the chapter needs. One thing is a foundational choice: we model computation inside a
cohesive ambient category. A different thing is a theorem inside that foundation: once you accept the setting, efficient
algorithms exhaust through modal profiles built from the five modalities because
{prf:ref}`cor-computational-modal-exhaustiveness` proves it.

That distinction matters. We are not asking the reader to accept modal completeness as a second unexplained axiom. We
are asking the reader to separate the ambient language from the theorem proved inside that language.

The natural-proofs caution stays the same. We are not giving a constructive detector for structure; we are giving a
non-constructive obstruction route. The proof works by showing that if all admissible modal profiles are blocked,
hardness follows.
:::

### Verification and Falsifiability

We now summarize how the proof chain can be verified, audited, and falsified theorem by theorem.

:::{prf:theorem} Verification of Classification, Obstruction, and Completion

| Bridge to DTM complexity | **THEOREM PACKAGE** | {prf:ref}`cor-bridge-equivalence-rigorous` and Part XX |

**Key Point:** The framework rests on mathematical theorems within cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos theory, not empirical
observations. The completeness burden is distributed over an explicit decomposition, irreducibility, exhaustiveness,
obstruction, and barrier-metatheorem chain. The general obstruction calculi, thin contracts, audit ledgers, and
backend dossiers are developed in the companion document *Algorithmic Extensions*.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Falsifiability Criteria
:label: def-falsifiability

The correct falsifiability claim is the theorem-level one already isolated in
{prf:ref}`cor-no-hidden-mechanism`, {prf:ref}`rem-proper-falsifiability-statement`, and
{prf:ref}`rem-proper-falsifiability-obstruction-layer`.

Concretely:
1. a true polynomial-time family outside the saturated five-class closure would refute some specific theorem in the Part
   IV classification ladder;
2. an irreducible witness object outside
   $\mathsf W_\sharp,\mathsf W_\int,\mathsf W_\flat,\mathsf W_\ast,\mathsf W_\partial$
   would refute {prf:ref}`thm-irreducible-witness-classification`;
3. a failure of the semantic obstruction propositions would refute one of the five blockage lemmas of Part VI;
4. a failure of the canonical 3-SAT instantiation would localize either to
   {prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-admissible`, {prf:ref}`ex-3sat-all-blocked`,
   {prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness`, or {prf:ref}`thm-internal-cook-levin-reduction`,
   not to some vague meta-level complaint;
5. a failure of a claimed barrier-based hardness route would localize either to the existence or translator-stability of
   the barrier datum, to one of the modal barrier lower bounds, or to the Part IX assembly theorems
   {prf:ref}`thm-barrier-package-implies-e13` and {prf:ref}`cor-barrier-contrapositive-hardness`.

That is a substantially stronger and more referee-usable falsifiability standard than the earlier slogan about
discovering a Class VI algorithm.
:::

:::{prf:remark} Relationship to Complexity Barriers
:label: rem-complexity-barriers

The algorithmic completeness approach relates to established complexity barriers as follows:

| Barrier | How Addressed |
|---------|---------------|
| **Relativization** (Baker-Gill-Solovay 1975) | Proof is structural, not oracle-based; modalities are intrinsic to the problem, not relativizable queries |
| **Natural Proofs** (Razborov-Rudich 1997) | Proof is non-constructive; does not claim to algorithmically detect structure absence. The hardness follows from mathematical analysis of modal obstructions, not from constructive circuit lower bounds |
| **Algebrization** (Aaronson-Wigderson 2009) | The flat modality $\flat$ explicitly includes algebraic structure; algebrization is subsumed as one of the five classes (Class III). Blocking $\flat$ now requires ruling out all admissible polynomial-size algebraic sketches, not merely visible automorphism quotients |

**Key Insight:** The proof operates at the **meta-level** of structural classification, not the object-level of specific algorithms or circuits. The barriers apply to constructive lower bound techniques; our approach is non-constructive, relying on categorical exhaustion.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Barrier Avoidance
:label: thm-barrier-avoidance

The proof technique employed in this document — classification of polynomial-time computation into modal
families ({prf:ref}`def-five-modalities`) followed by per-modality obstruction — is not blocked by the
three known barrier results: relativization (Baker–Gill–Solovay 1975), natural proofs (Razborov–Rudich
1997), and algebrization (Aaronson–Wigderson 2009).
:::

:::{prf:proof}

**Part 1. Relativization.**
A proof technique *relativizes* if it applies equally in any relativized world (i.e., in the
presence of an arbitrary oracle). The Baker–Gill–Solovay theorem shows that relativizing techniques
cannot resolve the P vs NP question because there exist oracles $A$ with $P^A = NP^A$ and oracles
$B$ with $P^B \neq NP^B$.

The modal classification/obstruction technique does *not* relativize because:

1. The five modalities are defined intrinsically in terms of the evaluator's structural properties
   ({prf:ref}`def-five-modalities`), not in terms of input/output behavior.
2. An oracle gate is a primitive that, by definition, computes an arbitrary function in one step.
   Such a gate is not classifiable into any of the five modal families: it does not satisfy a
   ranking-function descent ($\sharp$), dependency elimination ($\int$), algebraic cancellation
   ($\flat$), self-reduction ($\ast$), or interface contraction ($\partial$) — because its internal
   structure is opaque.
3. In a relativized world with a PSPACE-complete oracle, the oracle gate provides computational
   power outside the five modal families. The normal-form theorem ({prf:ref}`thm-syntax-to-normal-form`)
   does not apply to oracle gates because they are not part of the fixed finite instruction set
   $\Sigma_{\mathrm{eval}} \cup \Sigma_{\mathrm{prim}}$.
4. Therefore, the proof technique produces no conclusion in relativized worlds — it neither proves
   $P^A = NP^A$ nor $P^A \neq NP^A$. This is the correct behavior for a non-relativizing technique.

**Part 2. Natural proofs.**
A "natural" proof in the sense of Razborov–Rudich is one that uses a combinatorial property of
Boolean functions satisfying three conditions: (i) *usefulness* against a circuit class, (ii)
*constructivity* (the property is computable in polynomial time given the truth table), and (iii)
*largeness* (a random function satisfies the property with non-negligible probability). If one-way
functions exist, no natural proof can prove superpolynomial circuit lower bounds.

The obstruction technique is *not* a natural proof because:

1. It does not operate on truth tables or Boolean functions. It operates on *algorithmic
   representations* — normal-form trees of evaluator programs as produced by
   {prf:ref}`thm-syntax-to-normal-form`.
2. The obstruction is not a property of the function computed but of the *witness structure* of the
   algorithm computing it. Two programs computing the same Boolean function may have different modal
   classifications.
3. The property "admits no pure $\sharp$-witness" ({prf:ref}`def-pure-sharp-witness-rigorous`) is
   not *constructive* in the Razborov–Rudich sense: given a truth table, there is no polynomial-time
   procedure to determine whether a function admits a pure $\sharp$-witness, since this would require
   analyzing all possible algorithms for the function, not just the function itself.
4. Therefore condition (ii) fails: the obstruction properties are not efficiently decidable from
   truth tables.

**Part 3. Algebrization.**
An algebrization-blocked technique is one that, roughly, proves a statement that remains true when
the computation is "arithmetized" — i.e., replaced by low-degree polynomial extensions over a finite
field. Aaronson–Wigderson showed that algebrizing techniques cannot resolve P vs NP.

The obstruction technique is *not* algebrization-blocked because:

1. The $\flat$-modality's obstruction ({prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-integrality-blockage`,
   {prf:ref}`lem-random-3sat-galois-blockage`) *explicitly* blocks algebraic witnesses — including
   those that use polynomial extensions, Fourier transforms, and algebraic cancellation.
2. An algebrizing proof would treat algebraic extensions as "free" computational resources. The modal
   framework instead *classifies* algebraic computation as $\flat$-modal and then *blocks* it
   specifically via the integrality and monodromy obstruction certificates.
3. The five-channel obstruction blocks algebraic computation ($\flat$) as one channel among five,
   rather than ignoring it or treating it as transparent. This is the opposite of algebrization:
   rather than being blind to algebraic structure, the proof explicitly accounts for and blocks it.
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Foundational Status of the Framework
:label: thm-conditional-nature

The algorithmic completeness framework consists of a foundational choice and two proved theorem chains:

**Foundation (choice):** We work within Cohesive Homotopy Type Theory / cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos theory as the
ambient foundation ({prf:ref}`axiom-structure-thesis`). This is a foundational choice analogous to choosing ZFC as
the ambient set theory.

**Bridge Equivalence (theorem):** The Fragile/DTM equivalence theorems (Part XX) rigorously establish:

$$
P_{\text{FM}} = P_{\text{DTM}} \quad \text{and} \quad NP_{\text{FM}} = NP_{\text{DTM}}.
$$

This is proved by {prf:ref}`cor-bridge-equivalence-rigorous`.

**Internal Separation (theorem):** Parts V--VI and IX rigorously prove the internal separation:

$$
P_{\text{FM}} \neq NP_{\text{FM}}
$$

via:
- the Part VI canonical $3$-SAT admissibility and Internal Cook--Levin theorems
  ({prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-admissible`, {prf:ref}`thm-internal-cook-levin-reduction`,
  {prf:ref}`thm-sat-membership-hardness-transfer`);
- the direct Part VI E13 route
  ({prf:ref}`ex-3sat-all-blocked`,
  {prf:ref}`def-e13`,
  {prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness`,
  {prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-not-in-pfm`,
  {prf:ref}`cor-pfm-neq-npfm-from-random-3sat`);
- the reusable Part IX barrier-metatheorem route
  ({prf:ref}`def-barrier-datum`,
  {prf:ref}`thm-sharp-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`--{prf:ref}`thm-partial-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`,
  {prf:ref}`thm-barrier-package-implies-e13`,
  {prf:ref}`cor-barrier-contrapositive-hardness`).

**Logical Structure:**

Within the chosen foundation, the bridge equivalence and internal separation are theorems. Together they yield:

$$
P_{\text{DTM}} \neq NP_{\text{DTM}}.
$$

The Part VI internal separation follows by the direct canonical E13 theorem chain.
Part IX adds a reusable barrier-metatheorem route to the same obstruction conclusion.

**Status Comparison:**
- **Classical ZFC + P ≠ NP:** Unproven
- **Cohesive HoTT:** Bridge equivalence and internal separation are proved; classical separation follows by
  {prf:ref}`cor-internal-to-classical-separation`

The roles are therefore explicit: the foundation is a choice, the bridge equivalence and internal separation are
theorems, and classical export is their direct consequence.
:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
Let me be clear about what we have accomplished and what remains open.

**What is proven abstractly:** Within cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos theory, the manuscript states a theorem ladder
showing how witness decomposition, irreducible generators, and saturated closure exhaust internally polynomial-time
computation. On the problem-specific route, canonical $3$-SAT is then excluded from $P_{\text{FM}}$ by the direct E13
theorem chain, not by slogan. Part IX abstracts this into reusable barrier metatheorems.

**What is already implemented for canonical $3$-SAT:** The canonical $3$-SAT object is admissible, its direct frontend
E13 certificate package is now assembled in Appendix B, and it is tied to the class-separation argument by the internal
Cook--Levin theorem and the $NP_{\text{FM}}$-completeness theorem.

**What the bridge proves:** The equivalence theorem identifying the internal classes with the classical
Turing-machine classes is a rigorous theorem, not an assumption.

**What is a choice:** Working in cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos theory is a **foundational choice**, like
choosing to work in ZFC versus some alternative foundation. Within that foundation, the bridge equivalence
and internal separation are proved theorems, and classical $P \neq NP$ is their direct consequence.

The beauty of this approach is that it makes the roles **explicit**. The foundation is a choice. Everything else
is proved.

### Summary: What This Framework Establishes

:::{prf:theorem} Main Results Summary
:label: thm-hypo-algorithmic-main-results

The algorithmic completeness framework consists of the following core results:

**Theorem 1 (Modal Completeness):** In a cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos, the five modalities $\{\int, \flat, \sharp, \ast, \partial\}$ exhaust all exploitable structure ({prf:ref}`thm-schreiber-structure`, {prf:ref}`cor-exhaustive-decomposition`).

**Theorem 2 (Witness Decomposition):** Every internally polynomial-time family admits a finite modal factorization
tree ({prf:ref}`thm-witness-decomposition`).

**Theorem 3 (Irreducible Classification):** Every irreducible witness object lies in one of the five pure modal
subcategories ({prf:ref}`thm-irreducible-witness-classification`).

**Theorem 4 (Computational Modal Exhaustiveness):** The internally polynomial-time class coincides with the
saturated closure of the five pure modal classes ({prf:ref}`cor-computational-modal-exhaustiveness`).

**Theorem 5 (Mixed-Modal Obstruction):** If every irreducible modal route is blocked, then no internally
polynomial-time correct solver exists ({prf:ref}`thm-mixed-modal-obstruction`).

**Theorem 6 (Semantic Hardness from Obstruction):** If all five semantic obstruction propositions hold for a problem
family, it is excluded from $P_{\text{FM}}$ ({prf:ref}`cor-e13-contrapositive-hardness-reconstructed`,
{prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness`).

**Theorem 7 (Implemented 3-SAT Foundations):** Canonical $3$-SAT is admissible, the internal Cook--Levin reduction is
available, and canonical $3$-SAT is $NP_{\text{FM}}$-complete
({prf:ref}`thm-canonical-3sat-admissible`, {prf:ref}`thm-internal-cook-levin-reduction`,
{prf:ref}`thm-sat-membership-hardness-transfer`).

**Theorem 8 (Direct 3-SAT Exclusion Route):** The blockage lemmas of Part VI prove that canonical $3$-SAT satisfies the E13 antecedent
package and therefore lies outside $P_{\text{FM}}$
({prf:ref}`ex-3sat-all-blocked`,
{prf:ref}`def-e13`,
{prf:ref}`thm-e13-contrapositive-hardness`,
{prf:ref}`thm-random-3sat-not-in-pfm`).

**Theorem 9 (Direct Route Packaging):** The direct theorem route is packaged explicitly by Appendix B
({prf:ref}`thm-appendix-b-frontend-e13-certificate-table`).

**Theorem 10 (Barrier Metatheorem Layer):** Translator-stable barrier data and superpolynomial modal barrier lower
bounds yield reusable modal obstructions and hence hardness
({prf:ref}`thm-sharp-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`--{prf:ref}`thm-partial-barrier-obstruction-metatheorem`,
 {prf:ref}`thm-barrier-package-implies-e13`,
 {prf:ref}`cor-barrier-contrapositive-hardness`).

**Theorem 11 (Internal Separation Criterion):** Combining Theorem 7 with Theorem 8 yields
$P_{\text{FM}} \neq NP_{\text{FM}}$
({prf:ref}`cor-pfm-neq-npfm-from-random-3sat`).

**Theorem 12 (Classical Export):** Within the chosen cohesive $(\infty,1)$-topos foundation, the bridge equivalence ({prf:ref}`cor-bridge-equivalence-rigorous`) and internal separation (Theorem 11) are proved theorems. Together they yield
$P_{\text{DTM}} \neq NP_{\text{DTM}}$
({prf:ref}`cor-internal-to-classical-separation`, {prf:ref}`thm-conditional-nature`).
:::

:::{div} feynman-prose
And there you have it. We have built a mathematical framework that provides a structural analysis of **why** some algorithms are fast and others
must be slow. The five modalities are not arbitrary categories; they are the fundamental ways that structure manifests
in a cohesive topos. An algorithm is fast if it can "see" one of these structural patterns. An algorithm is slow if all
five views reveal nothing but noise.

This is the answer to the question: "Could there be a clever algorithm we have not thought of yet?" Within the
framework, any such algorithm must appear as a modal factorization tree built from the five structural types. Part IX
explains how reusable barrier data can block those modal routes in general.

The proof presentation makes the dependencies explicit. E13 does the obstruction work, the SAT transfer does
the internal class-separation work, Appendix B packages the direct frontend certificates, and the bridge chapter does
the model-export work. Each dependency now has its own named theorem.
