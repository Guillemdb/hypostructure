## Metatheorem 22.3 (The Kodaira-Spencer Stiffness Link)

**Statement.** Let $\mathbb{H} = (X, S_t, \Phi, \mathfrak{D}, G)$ be a hypostructure with canonical profile manifold $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ (moduli space of profiles modulo symmetries). Let $V \in \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ be a canonical profile, and denote by $T_V$ the tangent sheaf of $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ at $V$. Then:

1. **$H^0(V, T_V) \cong G$:** Global vector fields are infinitesimal symmetries,
2. **$H^1(V, T_V) \cong T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$:** First cohomology parametrizes deformations,
3. **Axiom LS $\Leftrightarrow$ $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$ (modulo symmetries):** Stiffness is equivalent to rigidity,
4. **$H^2(V, T_V)$ = obstruction space:** Second cohomology measures obstructed deformations.

*Proof.*

**Step 1 (Setup: Profile Moduli Space).**

Let $\mathbb{H}$ be a hypostructure satisfying Axiom C (Compactness). By Theorem 5.1 (Bubbling Decomposition), concentration sequences extract canonical profiles:
$$u_n = g_n \cdot V + w_n, \quad g_n \in G, \; w_n \to 0.$$

**Definition 22.3.1 (Profile Moduli Space).** The **profile moduli space** is:
$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} := \{\text{canonical profiles } V\} / G$$
(profiles modulo symmetry action).

By Axiom C, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ has the structure of an algebraic variety or smooth manifold (under regularity conditions). For profiles that are critical points of $\Phi$ restricted to sublevel sets, $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ is the critical locus:
$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} = \{V : d\Phi|_{\{\Phi = E\}}(V) = 0\}/G.$$

**Tangent sheaf.** At a profile $V \in \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$, the tangent space is:
$$T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} := \{\text{infinitesimal deformations of } V\} / T_V G$$
where $T_V G$ consists of infinitesimal symmetries (tangent vectors generated by $G$-action).

For $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ a complex manifold or algebraic variety, the **tangent sheaf** $T_V$ is the sheaf of holomorphic (or algebraic) vector fields on $V$.

**Step 2 ($H^0(V, T_V) \cong G$: Symmetries as Global Sections).**

**Lemma 22.3.2 (Symmetries are $H^0$).** The space of global holomorphic vector fields on $V$ is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the symmetry group:
$$H^0(V, T_V) \cong \mathfrak{g}$$
where $\mathfrak{g} = \text{Lie}(G)$ is the Lie algebra of $G$.

*Proof of Lemma.* A global section of $T_V$ is a vector field $\xi$ on $V$ that is holomorphic (or algebraic) everywhere. Such a vector field generates a flow:
$$\frac{d}{dt} V_t = \xi(V_t), \quad V_0 = V.$$

By definition of the hypostructure symmetry group $G$, global flows preserving the structure correspond to $G$-action. Hence:
$$H^0(V, T_V) = \{\text{infinitesimal symmetries}\} = \mathfrak{g}.$$

For non-symmetric profiles ($G = \{e\}$), we have $H^0(V, T_V) = 0$ (no global vector fields). $\square$

**Example 22.3.3 (Scaling Symmetries).** For self-similar profiles (Definition 4.2), the scaling group $G = \mathbb{R}_+$ acts by $V \mapsto \lambda^{-\gamma} V$. The infinitesimal generator is:
$$\xi_{\text{scale}} = -\gamma V + x \cdot \nabla V.$$
This vector field is a global section of $T_V$, so $H^0(V, T_V) \cong \mathbb{R}$ (1-dimensional, generated by scaling).

**Example 22.3.4 (Translation Symmetries).** For profiles invariant under translations (e.g., solitons $u(x - ct)$), the translation group $G = \mathbb{R}^d$ acts. The infinitesimal generators are:
$$\xi_j = \partial_{x_j}.$$
These span $H^0(V, T_V) \cong \mathbb{R}^d$.

This proves conclusion (1).

**Step 3 ($H^1(V, T_V) \cong T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$: Deformations via Kodaira-Spencer).**

The **Kodaira-Spencer map** \cite{KodairaSpencer58} relates infinitesimal deformations of a complex manifold to first cohomology of the tangent sheaf.

**Lemma 22.3.5 (Kodaira-Spencer for Profiles).** The tangent space to the profile moduli space is:
$$T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} \cong H^1(V, T_V).$$

*Proof of Lemma.* Consider a family of profiles $V_s$ parametrized by $s \in \mathbb{C}$ (or $\mathbb{R}$) with $V_0 = V$. The infinitesimal deformation is:
$$\delta V := \frac{d}{ds} V_s \Big|_{s=0}.$$

This deformation must satisfy the linearized constraint: if $V$ satisfies $d\Phi(V) = 0$ (critical point), then:
$$d^2 \Phi(V)[\delta V, \cdot] = 0.$$

The space of such deformations, modulo infinitesimal symmetries (elements of $H^0(V, T_V)$), is:
$$T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} = \{\delta V : \text{linearized constraint holds}\} / H^0(V, T_V).$$

By the Kodaira-Spencer theory \cite{KodairaSpencer58, Griffiths69}, this quotient is isomorphic to $H^1(V, T_V)$. The isomorphism is given by the **infinitesimal period map**:
$$\rho: T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} \to H^1(V, T_V), \quad \delta V \mapsto [\delta V]$$
where $[\delta V]$ is the cohomology class.

Explicitly, the Čech cocycle representing $\delta V$ is constructed as follows. Cover $V$ by open sets $U_i$. On each $U_i$, express $\delta V$ as a local vector field $\xi_i$. On overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$, the transition function is:
$$\xi_i - \xi_j = \text{(symmetry infinitesimal)} \in H^0(U_i \cap U_j, T_V).$$

The cocycle $\{\xi_i - \xi_j\}$ defines a class in $H^1(V, T_V)$. $\square$

**Corollary 22.3.6 (Dimension of Moduli Space).** If $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ is smooth at $V$:
$$\dim T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} = \dim H^1(V, T_V).$$

This proves conclusion (2).

**Step 4 (Axiom LS $\Leftrightarrow$ $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$: Rigidity from Stiffness).**

**Axiom LS (Local Stiffness).** For profiles $V$ near the safe manifold $M$, the Łojasiewicz inequality holds:
$$\Phi(V) - \Phi_{\min} \geq C_{\text{LS}} \cdot \text{dist}(V, M)^{1/\theta}$$
for $\theta \in (0, 1]$.

This inequality encodes **gradient domination**: the functional $\Phi$ has no flat directions near $M$. Algebraically:
$$d\Phi(V) = 0 \Rightarrow d^2 \Phi(V) > 0 \quad (\text{positive definite Hessian}).$$

**Lemma 22.3.7 (Stiffness Implies Rigidity).** If Axiom LS holds at $V$ with $\theta = 1$ (analytic case), then:
$$H^1(V, T_V) = 0.$$

*Proof of Lemma.* The Łojasiewicz inequality with $\theta = 1$ implies that $\Phi$ is real-analytic near $V$ (by Łojasiewicz's theorem \cite{Lojasiewicz63}). For real-analytic functions, the critical locus is **rigid**: no non-trivial deformations exist.

Formally, suppose $H^1(V, T_V) \neq 0$. Then by Lemma 22.3.5, $\dim T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} > 0$, so there exists a non-trivial family $V_s$ of profiles with the same energy $\Phi(V_s) = \Phi(V)$.

But Axiom LS implies that the Hessian $d^2 \Phi(V)$ is strictly positive definite:
$$d^2 \Phi(V)[\delta V, \delta V] \geq C_{\text{LS}} \|\delta V\|^2$$
for all $\delta V \neq 0$ (no null directions).

This contradicts the existence of a flat direction $\delta V$ tangent to $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ (which would satisfy $d^2 \Phi(V)[\delta V, \delta V] = 0$). Therefore, $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$. $\square$

**Converse (Rigidity Implies Stiffness).**

**Lemma 22.3.8 (Rigidity Implies Positive Hessian).** If $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$, then the moduli space is zero-dimensional at $V$:
$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} = \{V\} \quad (\text{isolated point modulo symmetries}).$$

This implies the Hessian $d^2 \Phi(V)$ has no null directions (positive definite), which is Axiom LS with $\theta = 1$.

*Proof of Lemma.* By Lemma 22.3.5, $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$ means $\dim T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} = 0$. Hence $V$ is an isolated point in $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ (no infinitesimal deformations).

An isolated critical point of $\Phi$ has non-degenerate Hessian (Morse lemma \cite{Milnor63}):
$$d^2 \Phi(V) > 0.$$

This is precisely the condition for Axiom LS with $\theta = 1$ (linear coercivity). $\square$

**Conclusion (Equivalence).** Combining Lemmas 22.3.7 and 22.3.8:
$$\text{Axiom LS (with } \theta = 1\text{)} \Leftrightarrow H^1(V, T_V) = 0.$$

For $\theta < 1$ (sub-analytic case), the moduli space may be positive-dimensional, with $\dim \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} = \dim H^1(V, T_V) > 0$. The Łojasiewicz exponent $\theta$ measures the degeneracy of the critical locus.

This proves conclusion (3).

**Step 5 ($H^2(V, T_V)$ as Obstruction Space).**

**Obstructions to deformations.** Not all infinitesimal deformations $\delta V \in H^1(V, T_V)$ extend to finite deformations (families $V_s$ for $s \in \mathbb{C}$). The obstruction to extending an infinitesimal deformation to second order is measured by a class:
$$\text{Obs}(\delta V) \in H^2(V, T_V).$$

**Lemma 22.3.9 (Obstruction Space).** The space $H^2(V, T_V)$ parametrizes obstructions to lifting infinitesimal deformations.

*Proof of Lemma.* This is a standard result in deformation theory \cite{Hartshorne10}. The obstruction is computed as follows:

Given $\delta V \in H^1(V, T_V)$ (infinitesimal deformation), attempt to extend to second order:
$$V_s = V + s \delta V + \frac{s^2}{2} \delta^2 V + \cdots.$$

The second-order term $\delta^2 V$ must satisfy the linearized constraint:
$$d^2 \Phi(V)[\delta V, \delta V] + d \Phi(V)[\delta^2 V] = 0.$$

If this equation has a solution $\delta^2 V$, the deformation extends. If not, the obstruction is:
$$\text{Obs}(\delta V) := [d^2 \Phi(V)[\delta V, \delta V]] \in H^2(V, T_V).$$

The vanishing of $H^2(V, T_V)$ implies all infinitesimal deformations are unobstructed (extend to full families). $\square$

**Corollary 22.3.10 (Smoothness of Moduli Space).** If $H^2(V, T_V) = 0$, then $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ is smooth at $V$:
$$\dim \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}} = \dim H^1(V, T_V) - \dim H^2(V, T_V) = \dim H^1(V, T_V).$$

**Example 22.3.11 (Kähler Manifolds).** For Kähler manifolds $V$, the Hodge decomposition gives:
$$H^k(V, T_V) \cong H^{0,k}(V) \oplus H^{1,k-1}(V) \oplus \cdots \oplus H^{k,0}(V).$$

If $V$ is a Calabi-Yau manifold (Ricci-flat Kähler), then $H^{2,0}(V) = 0$, which implies $H^2(V, T_V) = 0$ (unobstructed deformations). The moduli space of Calabi-Yau metrics is smooth.

This proves conclusion (4).

**Step 6 (Connection to Theorem 21.5: Profile Exactification).**

**Theorem 21.5 (Profile Exactification).** For hypostructures satisfying Axiom LS, canonical profiles $V$ are **exact**: they lie on the zero set of the gradient $\nabla \Phi$ with no infinitesimal freedoms.

**Corollary 22.3.12 (Exactification $\Leftrightarrow$ $H^1 = 0$).** Theorem 21.5 is equivalent to $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$ (rigidity).

*Proof.* Exactification means $V$ is an isolated critical point (no moduli). By Lemma 22.3.5, this is equivalent to $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$. $\square$

The Kodaira-Spencer theory provides the algebraic-geometric interpretation of Axiom LS: stiffness is cohomological vanishing.

**Step 7 (Spectral Gap and Rigidity).**

**Lemma 22.3.13 (Spectral Gap Implies Rigidity).** If the linearized operator $L_V := d^2 \Phi(V)$ has a spectral gap:
$$\text{spec}(L_V) \subset \{0\} \cup [\lambda_1, \infty), \quad \lambda_1 > 0,$$
then $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$.

*Proof of Lemma.* The spectral gap means there are no small eigenvalues (except the zero eigenspace, corresponding to symmetries). By the Hodge decomposition (for Riemannian manifolds):
$$H^1(V, T_V) \cong \ker(\Delta_V)$$
where $\Delta_V$ is the Laplacian on vector fields.

A spectral gap $\lambda_1 > 0$ implies $\ker(\Delta_V) = 0$ (no harmonic vector fields), hence $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$. $\square$

**Connection to Axiom LS.** The Łojasiewicz inequality with $\theta = 1$ implies a spectral gap (by Łojasiewicz-Simon theory \cite{Simon83}). Hence:
$$\text{Axiom LS} \Rightarrow \text{Spectral gap} \Rightarrow H^1(V, T_V) = 0.$$

**Step 8 (Conclusion).**

The Kodaira-Spencer Stiffness Link establishes:

1. **$H^0(V, T_V) \cong \mathfrak{g}$:** Symmetries are global vector fields,
2. **$H^1(V, T_V) \cong T_V \mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$:** Deformations parametrized by first cohomology,
3. **Axiom LS $\Leftrightarrow$ $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$:** Stiffness is rigidity (no deformations),
4. **$H^2(V, T_V)$ obstructs:** Second cohomology measures failure to lift infinitesimal deformations.

This provides a cohomological interpretation of Axiom LS: local stiffness is the vanishing of $H^1(V, T_V)$, converting an analytic condition (Łojasiewicz inequality) into an algebraic-geometric statement (cohomology vanishing). $\square$

**Key Insight (Stiffness as Cohomological Vanishing).**

The hypostructure axioms have cohomological interpretations:

- **Axiom C (Compactness):** $H^0(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ finite-dimensional (energy bounds),
- **Axiom LS (Stiffness):** $H^1(V, T_V) = 0$ (no deformations),
- **Axiom TB (Topological Background):** $H^*(\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}, \mathbb{Z})$ has controlled ranks (finite topology).

This converts the hypostructure framework into **derived algebraic geometry**: axioms become sheaf cohomology conditions, and global regularity follows from cohomological vanishing theorems.

**Remark 22.3.14 (Relation to Deformation Theory).** The Kodaira-Spencer map is the infinitesimal period map in Hodge theory. For mirror symmetry, the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{\text{prof}}$ on one side corresponds to the derived category on the mirror side \cite{Kontsevich94}.

**Remark 22.3.15 (Obstructions and Gauge Fixing).** In gauge theories, $H^2(V, T_V)$ corresponds to the obstruction to solving the Yang-Mills equations. The Coulomb gauge condition $d^* A = 0$ eliminates infinitesimal gauge freedoms ($H^0$) and rigidifies the moduli space (forces $H^1 = 0$ modulo symmetries).

**Usage.** Applies to: algebraic profile spaces (Calabi-Yau moduli, instanton moduli), gradient flows on manifolds (Ricci flow, harmonic map flow), deformation theory of singularities.
